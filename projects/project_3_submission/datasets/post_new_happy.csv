1bmbu9p,I just had one of the most delicious meals in a long time,"There wasn't anything special about it really. I just got back from helping my partner move a 9 hour drive away to school. I was driving back feeling very lonely, thinking about a lot of things, life in general. Called various family members and caught up with them. I finally made it home, got settled and took inventory of the food situation. Lots of ancient leftovers in the fridge. I made the ground turkey into taco meat, got the standard fixings together on the tortillas...

My God it was magical. Sometimes you feel like you need a good cry but then you have a good taco and everything is okay and you realize you don't need to cry. The universe put you right where you belong. You are strong. Things are pretty damn good and you get to live a very nice life.

I hope you all have a great night!

1bm8fue,I managed to minimize my screen time by about 65%.,"I am not a phone addict, but I always used to grab my phone and start doom-scrolling whenever I felt bored, which increased my screen time to somewhere around 5 hours. Deep down, I knew what I was doing was wrong and that I needed to quit, but I wasn't able to do so. Earlier this week, I read an article about phone addiction that mentioned a simple method. I decided to give it a shot in the hopes that it might at least aid me, and I am pleased to report that it worked. I won't claim I fully quit using my phone in a few days, but it did help me minimize my screen usage by about 65%.  ",saayoutloud,4,6,1711242519,happy

1blpd3q,"A Moment of Comfort, the Power of Parental Love. ","This past year has been challenging for me, though not as difficult as it has been for some. It's been filled with stress, the usual adult fare. My mom typically visits about three times annually, and we share a close, open relationship. We exchange hugs from time to time.

But today was different. I sat beside her on the couch while she worked on her laptop. Wanting to show her an article, we leaned in together to look at her screen. As I rested my head on her shoulder, a gesture I'm accustomed to, she wrapped her arm around me, causing me to sink into her lap. As we read the article, she began to stroke my back, reminiscent of when I was a child. In that moment, I was overwhelmed by a profound sense of security and comfort. It was as though I had yearned for something from my childhood without even realizing it. Tears welled up silently in my eyes, and I found myself crying softly. I longed for a return to the carefree days, devoid of responsibilities and stress, just me and my mom, offering unconditional support.

It dawned on me then that as adults, we often overlook our ongoing need for our parents' presence. We crave the connection and unconditional love that our (future) partners and (future) children provide. For those who still have the chance, I urge you to embrace your mom tightly for a while; it's truly invaluable. And to those who can't contribute positively, please refrain. Today, I needed that moment, and I hope to cherish this feeling for as long as possible before life's challenges resurface.",Connect_Hurry_6782,8,2,1711190914,happy

Today I won employee of the month!,"It's been a long journey with a lot of ups and downs, but I've finally found myself a job I can manage with hours that work for me despite my disability - and I thought I was doing ok, but it turns out I've been doing great! I work in health care and it's really important to me that my patients feel cared for and respected, so I'm overjoyed that I've apparently got so much positive feedback from my patients, as well as the other medical staff I work with. I'm not naturally a ""people person"" so it's pretty exhausting putting on my mask for every person who walks through my door, but this makes it feel worthwhile. 

To everyone who worries that they'll never be able to manage in the workplace, don't lose hope! When you're ready, keep searching and the right job could come along when you least expect it. I was struggling so much after years of trying to survive in the workplace that I ended up on a disability pension, deemed unable to work at all. Now I do five mornings a week, which isn't a lot by ""normal people"" standards, but I'm proud that I've made it this far. It's not the job I dreamed of doing and it isn't prestigious or glamorous but it's important work that I'm providing to the community.

1bhuj8n,My life has completely changed for the better ,"This is gonna start off sad, but I swear it gets better. 

August 2021 I graduated college. October 2021 I was given a job offer for a career I was incredibly excited about. The job offer payed decently, and was a stepping stone for my ex-gf and I at the time to be able to start moving our relationship into a more adult-relationship; ie, moving out, buying a house, etc. 

January 2022 I started at my job and loved it. March 2022 came around, and my ex at the time had blind-sided me and left without a word. I was devastated at the time. Fast forward a few months to October, I‚Äôm at the gym and I feel a tendon in the back of my leg snap. I can‚Äôt walk. I eventually go to the doctor who just diagnoses me with a strain and tells me to go to PT. 

Long story short, I visited 2 different doctors. Both of whom could not give me a proper diagnosis which caused the PT I received to only make things worse. I was on disability from my job to take care of my leg which just wouldn‚Äôt get better, as well as therapy for depression. Eventually, I was forced to leave my job, lost my health insurance, and didn‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd ever be able to walk again. I was alone, depressed, disabled, unemployed, and had no idea about the future and what was going to happen to me. 

Eventually, I found a physio who I was able to see via Zoom (about $20/visit, so I could afford it without insurance) who was able to diagnose me and we started a PT program that I was able to do by myself. It took a long time, but she got me back on my feet, back in the gym, back to running and everything. It took me about a year to walk again. It was an extremely long process. 

Near the end of my PT, I met this woman. Smart, funny, gorgeous, kind, driven and hard working, incredibly emotionally intelligent, and‚Ä¶ well I could go on for hours talking about this woman. We hit it off, and started dating. She‚Äôs introduced me to so many new hobbies, many of which are active activities. Some team sports, and some individual sports. I‚Äôve started some new sports of my own, and have began to introduce her to them as well. Not only has meeting her changed my life romantically, but I‚Äôve also gotten very close to all of her friends of which she has many. When my leg didn‚Äôt work and I lost my job, I was alone almost 24/7. I had very little help with anything from family and friends. It was the darkest time of my life. Now, I feel like it‚Äôs one of the most social and happiest times of my life. It‚Äôs been a complete 180 from where I was before. 

When my leg got better, I also applied for a federal job. I‚Äôd always wanted to work for the federal government, not just for the benefits but also for the job security. It was a very long and stressful process, but just last week I received the email with a firm job offer and I am due to begin working with them next week. 

My life has completely changed. I was in the darkest time of my life, not knowing what was going to happen to me and not knowing if I‚Äôd ever be able to walk again, hold a job, etc. I‚Äôve now picked up a handful of new hobbies, I‚Äôm exercising and running frequently, I have a new career which I‚Äôm beyond ecstatic to begin, and a wonderful girlfriend of which I can see an actual future with. 

Words cannot begin to describe how absolutely ecstatic I am for what my future holds. ",Wrastling97,306,16,1710778286,happy

I woke up one day and realized I have been ‚Äúwinging‚Äù it and ‚Äúhalf-assing‚Äù through life. I‚Äôm not in a terrible place. I have a decent paying management job in infrastructure. But this wasn‚Äôt the life young me wanted.

I got accepted in college and I‚Äôm about to start classes. I scored insanely well on the accuplacer (after countless hours studying). And the end goal is to finally pursue my dream and become a lawyer. It was my dream all as a child. But I spent too much time in high school skipping class and hitting the reefer. I graduated high school with a 2.0 GPA. I didn‚Äôt even understand math at all. I had Fs in every math class. But I self taught my self advance algebra and statistics in a matter of weeks before my test. And I‚Äôm so proud of that. (I was proud when I was doing 7th grade math test and passing lol) 

I‚Äôm sharing on here because I‚Äôm divorced and kinda alone. No one is by my side to share the joy with me. And all my coworkers laughed at me and one of my coworkers (who dropped out in 7th grade) keeps telling me how dumb I am for doing it. I just wanted to get it off my chest in a safe area because I‚Äôm genuinely stoked. 

This is a massive vent and humble brag. ",Mutcd_hater,232,20,1710538105,happy

1bc3sxd,Cleaned my house after living in a mess for 2 years because I finally got over the fact that I had to clean up after my mom and grandpa ,"I cleaned my house after living in a pretty big mess after 2 years. For context: I live with my mom and grandpa. my mom is a hoarder and also battles manic depression so she buys a lot of things to comfort herself (not hoarders tv show level but clothes, shoes, journals, pens, books). My grandpa hoards food (not sure why) and doesn‚Äôt like to get rid of anything even if it‚Äôs expired from 2019. I also can be messy and not put things back where they go. I spent a year being mad that I had to clean the place at all because I felt like I shouldn‚Äôt have to clean up after perfectly capable people and I knew they wouldn‚Äôt make an effort to keep it clean. I guess I got over that last week because I cleaned the entire house and had about 6 garbage bags full of things to throw out that hadn‚Äôt been used in years. What really prompted the clean was my mom essentially went to stay with her sister and didn‚Äôt give me any warning or anything. I guess I felt like if the house was clean she‚Äôd come back home. This was a super long rant but anyway I‚Äôm just proud of myself that I have continued the efforts of keeping the house clean and putting things back where they go even if my grandpa and mom don‚Äôt contribute because I realized if I want the house to stay clean, it‚Äôs going to have to be me doing the clean up.

1b9xvs5,"Due to fear of the dentist and the pandemic, I put off going ever since the pandemic began. Today I just got the final crown put in of a huge amount of work I needed to get done. The shadow in the back of my mind has been lifted.","When I finally got up the courage to go to the dentist, I discovered that I needed an old crown replaced, 2 fillings, and, worst of all, 2 root canals. I am terrified of drilling and each time I had to go to an appointment over the past few months, I had to steel myself. However, this entire few years that I have gone without seeing a dentist, I knew that it was just a matter of time before I had a major problem, or even caused myself a serious health problem. It was like I had a shadow of worry always hanging over my shoulder, even in happy moments, and I knew the only way to dismiss it was to finally go to the dentist and let them fix every single problem.  

I had been saving up for a new car, so that money is all gone now, but I don‚Äôt need a new car the way I need the blissful peace of mind that comes with finally resolving a serious problem that has followed me for years.  

And actually, it ended up being not the worst case scenario. I didn‚Äôt lose a single tooth. I didn‚Äôt have to get any implants. If I do better at taking care of my teeth going forward, I hope I can keep all of them. And I hope I don‚Äôt ever have to do a root canal again. And my mouth feels so much better.  

edit to add: I just want to describe some things that happened during my first appointment. I was so terrified I was trembling violently. During the part where they were examining my teeth, with various sharp implements, every time it hurt so much, I would flinch violently. Tears began to stream from the corners of my eyes. Until finally the dentist said ‚ÄúDo you need a moment?‚Äù and I sat up and the tech fetched my water bottle from my backpack. All of this was in the FIRST appointment, and all they were trying to do was find what was wrong, and what needed to be fixed, and I was so afraid, and my injured teeth hurt SO much. It was, all of it, built upon old childhood trauma, drilling when I wasn‚Äôt really numb, an elderly dentist chasing me around the chair and then yelling at my mother not to bring me in again if I was too stupid to let him help me.   

Anyway. I somehow made it through. Perhaps that first appointment _was_ the worst. Worse even than the root canals. ",pfemme2,123,14,1709928643,happy

I grew up on tv because I was a socially awkward kid and any friends I did have would want to hang with my brothers instead (we have a 6 and 7 year age gap. So when I was 8 they were teens). I saw that on a lot of my favourite shows there would be at least one picnic episode where the family would go to a park with the classic red and white blanket and eat out of a basket. I always wanted that. I would ask my mom if we could do it with her, my brothers and me ( my parents divorced when I was three and my dad had custody on weekends) but my brothers just wanted to go to the skatepark with their junkie friends. My mom chose them over me every time. So when I was 14 I stopped asking cause I knew that the one day I wanted with my family didn‚Äôt matter as much as wasting hours watching my brothers do the same old tricks. 
Anyway I haven‚Äôt seen my mother since I was 15 when my dad got full custody of me after my mom disappeared with her boyfriend of the week for a couple days.

As soon as I told my husband that I wanted to try it he lent me his account for buying the materials even though we're on a tight budget (I had surgery recently because of a broken bone in my left hand).

It sounds funny but I have dreamed of having my own snack drawer at my own desk in my own office for as long as I can remember.  While I may not have my own office, I have a nice cubicle next to a large set of windows in the corner of the building.  It's wonderful!

I spent the better part of a decade getting an undergraduate engineering degree and graduated at 33 while working to support myself and doing extracurricular projects.  There were so many times I just wanted to quit.  I moved around a lot and changed majors at one point so it took a while to get through it all but I did it.  I now work for a company that I've always wanted to work for and I have myself a snack drawer.

It's silly but this snack drawer reminds me of all the blood, sweat, and tears that went into getting my degree and I just feel so accomplished when I turn around, open it, and grab some crackers.  I've come so far since I was waiting tables with no direction in life and it's a nice reminder that all the hard work paid off.  I can't help but smile when I think about it.

1b5muou,My brother made me feel like I'm winning at life ,"First of all, English isn't my first language so please understand. 

I come from a country and a community where dating culture isn't very big. Me and my brother have a 8 year age gap (he's younger). As a result, we don't relate to the same stuff, share similar likes/dislikes or even talk a lot about our personal lives or choices. Although I find a friend in him and he's been protective, caring; he barely talks about his friends, or problems, etc. 

But today! Oh boy, I'm still smiling ear to ear!
Today he called me out of the blue( lives in a different city) and asked me for an outfit suggestion because he was going to go meet this girl he has had a crush on. That alone, made me so happy! In that moment, I knew he found me helpful, I knew he trusted me with that as probably my parents would not approve of him skipping classes to go meet her, and I was happy that he came to me when he felt like he was stuck.
I gave him a suggestion, appropriate for a first date (of his life) and he left. I was fine, happy that he was happy. It was just a little meet at a cafe at evening, they decided to have some snacks, talk etc and head back their own ways.

Fast forward three hours, HE CALLED me.. n he told me how great the date was!! I NEVER expected he'd call and share that with me! N he was so giggly (I don't know if that's even a word, sorry) and chirpy and happy and nervous and so much more lol! He told me, that she looked so beautiful this evening, that he couldn't utter a word. So he scrolled through Instagram, luckily came across a picture of  beautifully arranged flowers and he sent that post to her with a message that said - ""you look this beautiful today"". My little brother, ladies and gentlemen!! He's 19. 19!!! We never have seen anyone go on a date except in movies and stuff ig. And this guy was like 5yo just a couple years ago ü•∫ü•∫When did he grow up so fast! 

N to top all that, he thanked me - he THANKED ME for helping him know how to treat a girl right! He thinks I'm nice. He trusts me. He ACTUALLY looks up to me!!ü•∫
I. Am. Melting! 
I'm happy a ton! Sorry if this is too long. To the ones who stuck till the end, you people are my angels. I just wanted to share this. ‚ù§Ô∏è

He felt like he couldn't give me time. Which was totally ok and understable. 

Anyway in one of our conversation where he was stressed about not getting a job, I remember giving him a pep talk, and he told me then that when he gets a job I'll be one of the first few people he'll tell. 

It's been around two months since we stopped talking and he texted me today that he got a hired! I'm also suprised that he remembered and texted me about his job. I'm so happy for him. In suprising turn off events in currently unemployed after leaving a toxic workspace and seeing him get a job, made me feel not so bad about my own unemployment. So to whoever is in the same boat.

1b5c4ph,I quit all of these things to boost my own mental health and I am appreciating life more than ever,"These are the things I've quit to be more happy:

Competetive gaming: Its just a bunch of pixels on my screen that has no real value and it also made me lose the fun for videogames over the years. 

Social media: I still use social media but less than before. It took me a long time of self discipline to do that and nowadays I have a screen time of 20 min at best. I also think that social media helped me with that as well because whenever I read comments all I read are either bot comments, brainrot opinions or unnecessary hateful stuff. This also made me realize if the time I put into watching internet content is worth it or not. I have the mindset of using the Internet only for research purposes for things I dont know about so I can learn new stuff.

Bad eating behavior: I used to heavily rely on vitamin pills because I would always refuse to eat certain things because a doctor on YouTube would tell me this is bad or that is bad etc. It really ruined me as a person but today I'm doing a bit better now. I feel more happy now that my body is receiving the natural vitamins which was craving for years.

Being home all the time: I always saw my home as a ""safe"" place where I always wanted to stay all the time. 

Its quite dangerous over time and it does get to you mentally. I wasnt afraid of going outside and I dont have social anxiety but I always felt comfy being home and not doing stuff outside. Nowadays I always try to go outside whenever I can unless Im out of energy. I even bought a professional camera JUST so I can have a reason to go outside and do some nice pictures of nature or other things that look nice.

Quitting all of these things made me more of a happy person and I appreciate life more. Im almost 22 and honestly... maybe I should've listened to my mom but my teenage self had other things in mind. 

Have a nice day everyone :D",Akuyrni,53,6,1709453834,happy

He is the strongest man I have ever met, I admire and look up to him more than he knows. We passed our one year recently and my love for him still grows day by day. The world seems so colorful with meaning falling out of every single fold and crevice. Everything has meaning. Every little bug exists at the same time as we do. As incoherent as it is, I even find joy in realizing we both have eyes to look at the same things together. We are under the same sky. Somehow these axioms of the human experience feel much more meaningful because he‚Äôs alive with me. If I had killed myself when I was 17 I would have never known he was out there in this very world that I am in. Living his little 17 year old life, experiencing things that would make him the man he is today. I sometimes wish we would have met as babies.

Hi, i just got in high school last week and I didn't know anyone except for a friend of mine that ended up on the same school as me. A friend of her  also ended up there (wich i didn't know until yesterday). I just think it's worth to say that my social skills are terrible (expected from a reddit user lol), and i just find so difficult to start conversations, meeting people and stuff like that. On the first week i was dead silent, didn't talk to anyone, i was too shy and embarrassed, and felt like i would be a inconvenience to anyone just trying to stay in peace. Then yesterday (second week already), that friend of mine and her friend were talking to each other and they came to my desk to say something, and just stayed there for the rest of the lunch break, and we talked for a while until the class resumed. But today was even cooler, some of the teachers didn't show up on class, and we just talked the entire time about our lives. And believe it or not, it gets even cooler: we live in the same region, so we get the same buses on our way to home, and guess what: we talked the entire way lol. It just feels so nice to have someone to talk with that isn't on the internet, i was really missing that in-person social interactions haha.

The problem was that they applied 4 times, and each time, they either had just the smallest bit over income or they were not selected.

On the 5th application, my partner made sure that everything was correct, they were eligible, and she went to bat for them during committee selections, ensuring they got a house this time. They talked so often throughout the process and the mom called my partner her ‚Äúdaughter‚Äù, that is how close they became. Then one day, my partner gets home and tells me that this family got approved to get a new house after 2 years of rejections. I was floored with emotions as I had become so invested in their wellbeing. 

Now, my partner was the one that would be calling and letting the families know that they would be eligible to receive a home. I was so invested in this family that I made sure to listen to the phone call that she made to the mom of the family on speakerphone. As soon as she called, the mom thought something else was wrong and she didn‚Äôt get a home this round. Instead, my partner broke the news that they would be getting a house. That was when I immediately started balling my eyes out. I‚Äôm crying, my partner is crying, and the mom was crying.  It‚Äôs really hard to describe the amount of love the mom had for my partner and the gratitude she had for my partner doing everything she could to get them a home. I cried for a long time, even after they hung up. I‚Äôve never felt so happy for someone else being so happy. To this day, when I think about that phone call, I tear up and could cry just like that day. I‚Äôve never cried from happiness this way for anyone. As I write this, my eyes fill with tears thinking back to that beautiful moment. 

Later, the mom brought my partner a whole cake and other expressions of gratitude. It‚Äôs a moment that will stay with me for the rest of my life. Today, this family is thriving more than they ever have and we keep up with them. ",ilyalit,81,4,1709012706,happy

1azbdym,I think I made a positive impact on other kids with ASD and it's the best feeling in the world,"I didn't have anyone to share this with, so I decided I would do it here, just because I really wanted to say it to someone.

To start, I am a swimming teacher who works with young children. Lots of the kiddos who are put into my classes have special needs of some sort. I'm not exactly sure why, but I do have some experience working with special needs children, so I think I handle the groups fairly well. I know I'm not sharing anything groundbreaking, but I finally got to feel like I'm serving my purpose.

I had the mother of a little girl approach me yesterday. It was our last session together (I teach group lessons, and they run for eleven weeks). She asked if there was any way to make sure that her daughter could be in my class again next time.

This just made me feel like I was special in some way that helped this kiddo

 Over the weeks kids really come out of their shells, and this girl in particular had gone from being quiet as a mouse to bobbing around like a giggly little goldfish. I think she probably has ASD, and it always makes me so happy to see my ASD kids come out of their shells. I was one of those kids, and really remember how some of my swim instructors had such a huge impact on me.

This is a lot of words just to say that I think I've found a purpose. I know I can't teach lessons for much longer, as I go away to college soon, but I feel so blessed to have helped at least one kid. To know that another kid like me maybe found something they love. I don't know how to describe it, but hearing her mom say that to me kind of broke my heart in a good way. I feel so appreciated and happy. That's all :)",cluelessibex7392,47,5,1708824201,happy

1axijy9,A meh day with a meh workout turned into a good day after all,"Yesterdays workout turned into a slightly longer session than planned. I bought myself a luxurious licorice pipe (not the usual (Swedes knows which one I mean) , but an unknown, more expensive fancy variant!) and planned to treat myself after the session if I did well. The session felt... meh. I go to the reception to return a belly belt I borrowed for maxing out on the leg press, and then I see a guy yelling and causing a scene because his gym card is canceled for some reason. He's loud and creating an aggressive atmosphere. The receptionist is young and thin (less than 50kg), looking very uncomfortable. She has called the police. I try to talk to him.

- If you can't get in, and she only sees that it's blocked, and asks you to contact customer service, then there's nothing more to do. It's not her fault that your gym card is blocked.

But he talks about how badly he's being treated and tries to turn it into a racist thing.

- Call the police, do it! I'm not leaving this place!

And that I'm on the wrong side of what's right and wrong in the world.

- I swear to God! Jalla!

He gets up on a chair and starts waving and screaming even more. I tell him that when he's threatening and aggressive, it's not okay. It's still not her fault. If she asks you to leave, you have to leave. She's the one in charge here.

But he refuses to listen and just keeps rambling about... I don't really know what. That if it were the other way around, he wouldn't be treated this way, and blah blah blah. I wasn't on the HUMAN side, but on the INHUMAN side!

Mkay. Sure, but now she's asking you to leave. She can't do anything about it. He tries to call customer service, but as they don't answer at this time, he gets upset about how unfair it is. Gets up on the chair again, screaming and waving, hitting the lights above him, causing them to flicker. After maybe twenty long minutes of meaningless ranting, three police officers finally come and remove him, and talks to the receptionist.

I go back and stretch a bit. After a while, she comes by, and I see that she is upset and close to tears. First, she apologizes for what happened; it's not something I should have to endure. But she was glad that I was there and handled the situation. I say no worries, it was obvious I had to do something. And SHE shouldn't have to endure this at work. 

I go shower and sauna, and when I'm done and on my way going through the gym to the entrance, I see her again, and ask if she likes licorice. 

-Yes, she answers curiously. I offer her my luxury licorice pipe. She is surprised and wonders if I don't want it for myself. I say it would have been my reward if I had a good session, but it was meh. And, I think she should have something good happening today. She thanked me and said it made her very happy! And that made me happy too, despite the bad session. Win-win! ",Iampepeu,20,7,1708637919,happy

I know this sounds so silly but I F18 and finally had the epiphany of how important school, college and university is.
 
The majority of people in my area aren‚Äôt taught this in school therefore others my age drop out of college, do boring 9-5 jobs and don‚Äôt see the importance of their education.

Luckily I go to a college closer to the capital city of my country where everyone has a better work ethic, than the locals I‚Äôve been influenced by. 

I used to be so confused as to my my peers would be so motivated to go to class everyday, work hard, revise for exams etc, usually I would skip class, stay home, not revise.
Until I realised the importance of how these few years of education, trial and error and putting in your best actually shape your entire life! 

I was reading up on the entry requirements for the courses I‚Äôd want to do in uni and never realised you‚Äôd actually need good grades, and a college degree etc.

I know I seem silly for only realising all of this now, but I‚Äôm actually feeling very hopeful for my future and I‚Äôm looking forward to it.

1atzpz8,Wanna hear the one sentence my dad said that made me misty eyed?,"‚ÄúHow is her brother doing?‚Äù

Weird, right? Ill make it make sense!

My best friend passed away 2 years ago, we have guardianship of her 17f daughter, and are active in her 18transM‚Äôs son‚Äôs life. We‚Äôll call him K.

I have boomer parents. I would gently correct them when they referred to the kids as ‚Äúthe girls,‚Äù or used the incorrect pronouns for K. I was understanding that they were going to mess up here and there because of the generational gap, but figured after consistent gentle corrections, they would get there sooner than later.

I was wrong. After nearly 2 years, I felt I gave them more than enough grace to get it right. My mom has been the main culprit of the two because she always wants to talk about the kids, while my dad never really asked/talked about them as often (man of few words type). I started getting more aggravated and upset every time my mom would ask ‚Äúhow are the girls doing?‚Äù After 2 years, I just felt like my parents just didn‚Äôt care enough to even try to understand. I stopped bringing the kids around my family because I felt like it was always a negative experience for them, and refused to subject them to that kind of environment.

Fast forward to last week: I was talking to my dad on the phone. He was asking about 17f because I had mentioned she was starting school again soon and she just had a birthday. After we were done talking about her, he said the sentence:

‚ÄúHow is her brother doing?‚Äù

0 coaching. No correcting. Just him using his own words. 

I couldn‚Äôt believe it and actually stuttered a bit after that one sentence. That was the first time I heard one of my parents affirm his gender identity. 

My dad does care and has been listening. My heart exploded. I had hella tears.

1attgzh,I can confidently say that I am comfortable in my own skin!!," For some quick context I am an adult male. So to get right into what the title says. My whole life I always felt ""fat"" or ""ugly"". I'm not really sure what had convinced me to think this. I would not starve myself but would purposefully avoid meals or avoid drinking literally anything. This was the case for a good majority of my life so far (I'm 18 now just for reference). This train of thought, obviously damaged my self image, just leading to even more self conflicting issues. around the age of 15 I realized that I wasn't straight, turns out I was bisexual, (""great another reason to hate myself""). I felt even more isolated from others in my life. When I was 17, I accidently came out to my brother and step-mom, I remember going back to my room silently panicking, then venting to my best friend over text. The very next day my dad was joking around and said something like ""you saving yourself for that perfect girl....or BOY!?"" and I very stupidly said yes to both, realizing what I said made me internally panic again. To my surprise, my dad (who is Christian) was very very okay with it. For the days I almost began to cry on my way to school, due to the amount of weight lifted off of me. through the last remaining months of the year I felt like I was finally being accepted. To speed up this annoyingly long story, during the months leading up to and past my 18th birthday I was hit like a truck with a wave of sadness, tried something that I'm really happy it didn't workout, opened up to my step-mom and dad about it , got therapy, and processed my feelings healthily. This lasted for a 3-4 month period. Now in the year 2024 I still have my issues that I solve, but I have this underlying feeling of pure happiness that just sits dormant inside of me. I'm not sure if its an underlying issue problem of mine. Almost every time I go to take a shower I spot myself in the mirror (I'm usually fully clothed or just shirtless). I would stop and jokingly flex and check out myself (too clarify the mirror was only tall enough to show from above my head down and about to slightly above the waist), then proceed with my shower. Even today, I felt a surge of 5 am confidence and decided to open obs and take off my shirt and started to pose and check out myself out a bit and I thought in an exaggerated way ""omg I'm kinda... hot!"". Just being able to type this story out makes me feel so much appreciation for just life and how far I have progressed in my life. I know this sounds very cheesy, but I feel that if I were to meet younger self, my younger self would be very proud of us. I still feel random surges of sadness every now and then, but I usually break free from those episodes within the week. I can now confidently and proudly say that I'm happier now than I ever been in my ongoing life, and I know now that I'm not alone and I wont ever be. So as I go to end this embarrassingly long post, I want you, the reader to know you're loved and cared about. Sorry if this is hard to understand or if the grammar is a horror show to yall, I've been contemplating typing and posting this for a stupid amount of time and plus its almost 7 am.

1aswe2k,Destined Hearts: A Journey of Love from Online Connection to Real-Life Happinessüíú,"We (24F) and (22M) met on an app called Yocket, which is popular in India for graduate abroad studies. One day, she texted in the group about the decision deadline for a particular university. I saw the message and made a joke, which made her laugh. Intrigued, I wanted to learn more about her, so I checked out her profile. It turned out she had applied and got an admit from the same university where I had applied.

I decided to direct message her, asking about her application process and the decision. What started as professional college talk gradually turned into more personal conversations about our day-to-day activities and common interests. It all began on March 19th, 2023. Her age-related freakouts, even when we were just friends, were adorable.

By July, we found ourselves flirting without even fully knowing that we were ‚Äúflirting‚Äù. We gave each other nicknames‚ÄîI call her Goldie, and she calls me Twee. The nicknames stemmed from a funny story; she forgot few things, so I jokingly called her Goldfish (with its 15-second memory), which eventually led to Goldie. Twee came from star > twinkle > twee; she called me Starfish (with no brain) after I said something silly.

As I was about to fly to the USA for my higher studies on August 8th and yeah she couldn‚Äôt make it this year cause of some personal reasons, she sent me a long, heartfelt text when I was at the airport. It made me realize I was leaving something behind in India, even though my dream was to live in the USA. The text stirred emotions in me that I had never felt before.In the USA, I struggled to express my feelings or ask her out, but on August 13th, I finally did it, and she said, ""Fuck yes."" Despite not meeting or speaking on calls, we texted for hours every day. However, we knew long-distance wouldn't work without meeting in person, so I decided to visit her after my first semester, which was six months away. We didn't meet before I flew to the USA because I'm from a city that's 350 kilometers away from hers, and we also didn't acknowledge our feelings while I was living in India. We regretted that after August too much, and it was hilarious.

After a month, we started doing calls and decided to meet in person, skipping video calls and only sharing pictures. Although we knew we were in love, we didn't say it outright; instead, we used phrases like ""I purple you"" and ""I l you."" Purple became our color because One day, while I was assisting her with the application process, she thanked me with a purple heart instead of a red one. Later, she revealed that she didn't want to give the ""wrong impression"" by sending red hearts lol. From that moment on, purple became our color in everything, from hearts to flowers and to act more goofy, like Avengers' ""I love you 3000,"" we chose 2468 as our special number.

In January, I flew to India, and on the 6th, we finally met. It was nerve-wracking as she sat at Cubbon Park in Bangalore, facing away from the entrance which was extremely adorable. When I tapped her shoulder, she turned and we hugged for solid two minutes which was the best moment of my life. I spent the entire January with her, When we began our personal conversations, we discovered a shared love for a special dessert: blueberry cheesecake. We always dreamt of sharing it in person, so after 6-7 months of anticipation, we finally had our first cheesecake date in January. We also exchanged bouquets of purple flowers and now that I've flown back to the US, I miss my baby Gold so much. I just wanna be with her all the time.

I‚Äôve been single 4 years as I‚Äôve been working on bettering myself. I‚Äôve been through a rough past 20 years. But I‚Äôm finally in a healthy spot for a relationship. The 3 years I‚Äôve lived in my apartment I‚Äôve had my eyes on this amazingly gorgeous woman. I‚Äôve watched suitors come and go and I‚Äôve dealt with my emotions in that regard. Yesterday I gave her and her family each a valentine. In hers I left one o those make shift coupons to take her and her daughter out to eat, should she ever choose to use it. A few minutes ago I was taking out the trash and met them all as they were coming home.

1art3iw,A random thoughtful gift from a kind stranger made a little girl‚Äôs day (and her Mom‚Äôs),"A close encounter of the saintly kind‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶At the grocery store with my daughter. She‚Äôs little, so tends to have the ‚ÄúPlease, buy me everything!‚Äù anytime we‚Äôre in the store. Most of the time she‚Äôs fine with a ‚ÄúNot today, sweetie.‚Äù but today, she was in her feels because ALLLLLLLL of the day-after Valentine‚Äôs Day items were smack dab in front of the door when we walked in. She wanted a balloon. Mommy said ‚ÄúNot today, sweetie.‚Äù and today, that ‚Äúnot today‚Äù didn‚Äôt go over very well. She proceeded to be very pouty. Meh, it happens. 

Well, we‚Äôre in an aisle looking for artichoke hearts and there stood a kindly, bespectacled, affable looking gentleman. I asked his pardon as we passed. We started making small talk after he tried to engage my daughter and she made it very clear that she wanted a balloon and wasn‚Äôt allowed to have one. He laughed and looked at me chuckling. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt get easier as they get older!‚Äù to which I replied ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs six‚Ä¶ pray for me!‚Äù 

The kindly gentleman (before we learned his name) knelt down and said to my daughter ‚ÄúYou know‚Ä¶ balloons are wonderful, but they are often the best when they‚Äôre surprises, so maybe you can look forward to getting one when you least expect it.‚Äù This seemed to go over well with my daughter. 

The kindly gentleman (Mr. Myles, I came to know) and I continued chatting about kids, life, and random musings, eventually parting with a genuine sense of happiness over the entire interaction. He proceeded to the front of the store and my daughter and I continued our shopping. 

A few moments later, he found us at the back of the store with a heart shaped balloon. With the biggest smile ever, he handed it to my daughter and said ‚ÄúSee? Isn‚Äôt it so much better when it‚Äôs a surprise?‚Äù I was dumbfounded, more tickled pink than I‚Äôd been in a while and said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an absolute angel! No wait- a Saint!

The over-commercialization of romantic love makes it even worse. The truth is, we are whole just as we are.  Sure we all come with baggage but that doesn‚Äôt make us incomplete.  This is your reminder that you don‚Äôt have to go through today feeling alone.  This is your chance to pour all of your love into the most important person in your life: you!

Right now, I‚Äôm sitting with a glass of my favorite (Verdi) wine, snuggling with Bruno the stuffed red dragon and my two cats.  I bought myself flowers again this year and added the purple rose because they are my favorite.  I lit my favorite Apotheke candle.

1ap9iro,I was feeling particularly shitty tonight and my girlfriend made me feel things I've never felt before,"So basically I (20 M) have lost a shit ton of weight from say weighing 120 kilograms to right now weighing 83 kgs. I regularly go to the gym and I have them muscles too. There's just one teeny tiny issue. I was a hell of a glutton when I was chubby, and that habit still persists in the form of my sweet tooth and binge eating, though not often. 
Today, particularly, I'd eaten more than I'm supposed to, on my calorie deficit, by say 200-300 kcals, and all the PTSD came rushing to my head. I know it's not healthy, but this does not happen often. Okay so, my girlfriend rudely cut my video call cause her friend called and the girls had a nice time putting on face masks and stuff (when my girl (19 F) had told me before that she would do that with me on video call, while we talk.) So obviously this made me feel bad, and along with the PTSD, made my emotions avalanche down the fkin mountain. 
Cue me calling my girl a bit later, she goes ""tell me what's the matter"" in the most bored voice ever. I couldn't stop myself, tears started flowing down my eyes. I didn't know how to tell her what the matter was, and that made my emotions plummet even more.
However, after a while, I gathered composure, told my girlfriend the reasons, that I missed my father, and my grandmothers every single day, think about the days they were alive, and that I get motivation from them, to succeed. I told her about the PTSD regarding my body image issues, and what I consider as freedom from this: I want to be able to rip of my shirt and wear shorts without worrying about my physique whatsoever. (Not to mention I want that athletic physique and am working towards it). 
Where I knew that I'd won, with her as my girlfriend, is when she listened through everything, then at the end, told me stuff I exactly wanted to hear. That how she'd shown a pump picture of mine to one of her guy friends and how the guy praised my physique, how she'd storied a picture of me with a beautiful Persian cat (she was absolutely wonderful, the cat) on instagram, and how her friend replied ""Where were such beautiful and wonderful guys when I was searching for them? What kinda black magic did you perform that suddenly you get such a great guy to be your boyfriend?"". I feel absolutely elated right now.
There was this day I wore a semi-transparent shirt out, and my girl said today: listen babe, yk, I know we went to a temple that day but I could not help thinking unholy shit to do to you.

I hope this story will encourage someone to follow their heart.

I was on a trip by myself ( few months after being ghosted by my ex bf ) last day of my vacation I wanted some company so I downloaded tender and asked a guy who seemed not talkative at all if he wants some coffee, he said ""ok 10 min"" , to my surprise he showed up in exactly 10 min, we had a walk trying to find coffee at 11 pm, didn't find any so we got 2 bottles of water found a seat outside a store and started talking about our day, telling each other funny random stories, we're from different countries ( english is not our first language ) so we used google translate most of the time. we ended the date in an hour or so, I was feeling so weird, I felt like I just met my best friend it felt so warm and comfortable. same night I texted him again if he wants to come over, and it was the best day of our lives, we stayed up for a whole day talking laughing we went to the beach got matching bracelets then I had to go back to my real life..

he visited me couple days after, I know it's crazy but I asked him to be my bf on the second date and he said yes that he was as crazy and wanted to ask me the same. after a week we decided we want to stay together, like forever, so why not just get married? I left my job, he met my family, got in engaged and our wedding day finished some nightmare paperwork, and got married 3 months from the first time we met.

it's been 8 months now, it wasn't all butterflies, we had so many arguments, we went through very difficult times, but every day we get to love each other more.

He called me to ask how I was doing, and of course I lied and said I was doing OK. He said he was doing fine too and we talked for a bit. And he also asked that we should hang out sometime, and said sure.

Eventually my money finished and I ended with things I needed to do but had no money and worst of all a few days ago my cousin kept bugging me about a money I owed her this really made me so worried because I hate owing people money and hate people thinking I‚Äôm deliberately refusing to pay them but I really didn‚Äôt have the money 

I even cried because it‚Äôs not like I could borrow from someone else to pay her because no one ever believes me when I say I‚Äôm broke they just think I want to get more money or they think she is from a rich family her parents definitely give her money whenever she wants. They don‚Äôt, my parents have never believed in giving their kids everything, I mean they give other peoples kids everything but not theirs so I guess everyone would think they treat us the same way but it‚Äôs not like that 

Anyways today my mom called and said hey I sent you some money and the first thing I said what do you need me to get for you or pay or who should I send it to because that usually it and she said no it‚Äôs for you. For a second I thought she was joking and I was like what did you say I should do with this money, and she said it‚Äôs for you. I was so happy I wanted to cry. So I asked can I really use this money and she goes yes. I don‚Äôt know how she knew I needed money so badly because I didn‚Äôt tell anyone but I guess she could tell since she is my mom and I love her so much.

Update: I got paid today finally üòä. Thanks for the sweet comments my mom really is a great mom.

I wish I wrote down the rest of them because I already forgot most of it (my memory is so bad and my life is so dramatically different than it was 3 months ago; new huge things are happening every week; last night I just got the keys to a house on the beach in Venice). There was one thing she said which did stick out, though:

""You're my type: extraordinary.""

No one has ever come close to making me that happy with less than 6 words.

Anyway, I'm about to make one of the biggest pivots of my life. I got an offer to leave the US and move to Switzerland\* and possibly Germany for a bit, so I'm working to change every last piece of me that has been holding me back.

I honestly don't know that I could ask for a better compliment.

Anyway.

To future me, if you end up reading this, and you're feeling down, you were extraordinary to one of the most amazing people you ever met. That should not ever not matter to you.

\* it was somehow endearing how upset she got over this; I hate hurting her, even if it was inadvertent, but seeing her very upset texts burst through as I'm ""reviving"" my dead phone from an eventful night, was so \*damn\* heart-warming.",coldWasTheGnd,38,8,1707613859,happy

1ahg098,"A good day with little wins, slowly regaining confidence after Postpartum mood disorder","I had a good day today and wanted to share, hopefully someone out there can relate.

I am recovering from Postpartum mood disorder, it manifested as anxiety, and I had 'baby brain' which I didn't understand until I started to regain the ability to make decisions and perform tasks without feeling overwhelmed.

Today I remembered to do the things I set myself as tasks just as I was falling asleep last night. I have difficulty falling asleep, I often lay awake for 2 hours, just random thoughts, and often remember things I've forgotten to do and make myself mental to do list which I then regularly forget. Such as put pen and paper on bedside table to write down the to do list. (No phone near bed) Anyways, last night I remembered that I had forgotten to reply to an email I received a week ago, and today I replied, first little win. I also remembered I had to email stationery shop to get them to print a document for me, and I also remembered to go to the stationery shop to collect the print out. Double little win.

The biggest little win for me today was answering phone call that I felt was going to be awkward conversation, phone rang, I looked at display, realised it was awkward conversation, felt dread, thought about ignoring it and letting it ring out, but I answered, had the awkward conversation, and then it was done, finished, no more dread. Little win.

It doesn't sound like much I know, but to me it's a day of wins.

4 years ago I had a shopping bag full of unopened letters, that I was hiding because I didn't know what to do with them. Nothing scary in them, usual household bills, statements, renewal information, nothing that today I couldn't handle. But 4 years ago, it felt impossible. Postman would bring letters, I took them out of post box, and then stuffed them in shopping bag I hid in garage. Why? I don't know exactly. If I opened a letter I would then have to 'deal with it', whatever it was, and in my Postpartum mood I couldn't. The thought of opening envelope, then reading contents, then making decision to file document, go to home office room, go to bookcase, find appropriate folder, find hole punch, place document in folder, well, that was just impossible to accomplish. And that was for simple notification letter. What if it was a letter I had to do something with? Car insurance renewal? No way. Couldn't handle that. Ringing around to get quotes, comparing policies, nope, couldn't do it. Just hide the letters.

Today I can open letters. It's taken a long time to get here, I did it and I'm celebrating the little wins. If you understand, wonderful.",Happy_Perspective583,17,3,1706912439,happy

I told them I liked them, and they got so excited, asking me over and over again if I was being for real. They told me so many cute things, like ""you make me feel like I'm so cared about"" and ""you're face- it just makes sense to me.""

We were walking out of class, and I told him: your smile is so, so contagious, Annd immediately he smiles incredibly wide at me, his two small dimples on the sides of his lips show, and it was the cutest thing ever, and super rewarding. Then we walk past a classroom with his friend in it, which he interrupts me, but my crush goes:

""SHUT UP, she's SPEAKING. Continue, please, continue."" So I do, but I tell him that.""Yeah, yeah, I know I'm boosting your ego, but it's like- actually super amazing, and..."" To which my face is pratically melting off, which he points out, telling me my cheeks are beet red.
Then says: 

""It's kinda hot, ngl"" I wasn't sure whether he said, ""Your face is super hot red,"" I was too dizzy from the amount of blush on my face.

1ag446e,Parents are emotionally becoming more aware and it is helping me massively with my mental health,"
I have been bullied for a lot of my childhood for various reasons and one of them was me being a little chubby (I was not even overweight) so it naturally destroyed my self confidence and caused me to develop anxiety and even depression at one point. I also struggle with binge eating while stressed. 

Now growing up my parents might have made a few mistakes here there that I could not handle but lately they seem to talk to me in a more positive and mature manner and it warms my heart. I know for a fact that they had to unlearn certain behaviours and ideas to have this outlook.


For example the other day I noticed that my favourite pair of jeans started ripping apart near the thigh area and I was beating myself up for it getting torn because I have put on weight since I bought them two years back. My parents casually reassured me that it was just a piece of clothing and I can always get a new pair that fits me perfectly. They also said clothes are meant to fit you and not the other way around . It might not sound much to them but for me it was a huge deal. 

Also I love dressing masculine and wearing clothes from men‚Äôs section all the time, even though I personally think clothes are genderless but corporate world doesn‚Äôt really think the same right, so we happen to have a lot of stores that exclusively sell menswear. When I first started to ask my mom to take me the store she immediately took me there no questions asked, she never says anything to me when getting clothes from the men‚Äôs section. I know this is how it should be but I know a lot of friends who aren‚Äôt allowed to do the same.  I mentioned this to her and she casually went clothes are for comfort and people can wear whatever they want as long as they feel good wearing them üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è

Even as a welder, the most I have ever made doing back breaking work was $20.60 an hour. I currently make $18.22 an hour as a lead IT processing technician. Since 2021, I have been going to school for an A.A.S in multimedia/web development. I joined this company in 2022 and worked up to a lead IT processing technician. And today I was just offered a software developer job for $50,000 a year.

I wont lie, yes, I worked INCREDIBLY hard. I am in the honors society as the VP of communications and public relations for our school chapter. I have maintained a 4.0 GPA (I am graduating in May, I have 2 classes left that I am currently taking) and am so close to graduating with highest honors in my community college. I won an award last year in our state that only 55 students out of 200,000+ community college students called the All-State Academic Team and won a scholarship for Women in STEM. I am a very ambitious and have strived so much through this

BUT, I would have not had this job opportunity if I didn't have luck on my side. Working at this company, I found out they have a software developer team, and did my best to network with them and the adjacent IT team since I started. I had people who I made friends with who spoke my name when the software developer team asked about possible internal candidates. Just like it was luck for them that they actually had an internal employee who lives close enough to their facility who just happens to be going to school for web development, I just so happen to be lucky to work at a place where I could even move up like this.

There were 192 candidates, some of them being other internal employees. And I got it. me. I can't believe this.

1acmxfa,"I dropped my English course, and this was good for my mental health!","I‚Äôm in community college, and I found that for this semester (spring semester) I‚Äôd gotten a bad English professor. I received a 25/50 on an assignment due to not formatting it correctly - on ratemyprofessor, many students were complaining about his oddly specific formatting rules (this man expected us to read five pages to adhere to his formatting guidelines‚Ä¶ no thanks!) I‚Äôd actually started the assignment I received a 25/50 on early and had trouble submitting it in the docx form he really wanted us to submit it in, had to stop my Child Development Zoom meeting to call my college‚Äôs tech support at nighttime just to find a way to submit this assignment. This professor said he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt sure‚Äù and that I ‚Äústill had time to call‚Äù when I asked him if I‚Äôd receive a 0 if I was unable to get the document submitted by the deadline even though I mentioned I‚Äôd started it early and that it was done. 

After much crying yesterday when seeing I had a 25/50 (this lowered my grade to a D+‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never had a D+ in an English class) I simply decided, even though it means I‚Äôll only be taking three courses this semester, to just drop the class. I have a job, I don‚Äôt know what I see myself doing in the future, and I felt like I just don‚Äôt have time for this, so I chose to drop the class. No extra stress needed.

At school I hated working, would much rather be playing sports or video games. Throughout uni whilst I found some topics interesting, I hated any hard graft, would much rather be lounging about. I had kind of just accepted that I would forever just do my job to get paid then rush home at the end of the day. 

My first couple jobs were very much like that. I was there for a pay check, would not spend a second more than I needed to there. 

I‚Äôve just had an incredibly busy/tiring/stressful week, and as I sit slumped on the sofa watching a film I find myself somewhat looking forward to Monday and to getting stuck right back into it? This is a completely alien concept for me and I‚Äôm not sure how to process it. I‚Äôm incredibly thankful and I just kind of wanted to get it off my chest without appearing like bragging to my friends. 

A) what do I do with this good energy? Do I just accept that I‚Äôm lucky and crack on?

B) I wanna hear about others that love their job- not the money or how easy it is, who really loves putting in effort and showing up Monday morning? And to those people how do I stay like this?

1abc1mm,I finally figured out my plan for life and I‚Äôm happiest I‚Äôve ever felt in my life!,"So, I‚Äôm 21 and have gone through a lot of hardship over the last few years. This has made me change my general plan for life a couple of times. But, after switching my major a few times, I decided I want to get a BS in IT. When I‚Äôm done with school, I want to move to Las Vegas. I was born in Las Vegas and lived there for the first 10 years of my life. Besides, IT does much better in Vegas than the state I live in. 

I also figured out, after soul searching the last month, that I really am trans (I had a period where I questioned if transitioning was the right choice for me and I figured out it was and I want to continue it!), I don‚Äôt want kids, I‚Äôm a stoner, and I‚Äôd be content being single. However, if someone comes along that‚Äôs fine too. I‚Äôm very eccentric (very neurodivergent and crazy life), so if I‚Äôm gonna find someone romantically, they‚Äôre gonna be in a place like Las Vegas. Basically, what I thought I wanted in life is very different then what I ‚Äúwanted‚Äù in life at 19. I put quotations as I used to think, ‚ÄúI should live this way‚Äù instead of thinking of what I wanted.  

I fell into a deep depression after a break up around thanksgiving as I questioned what my true purpose in life was. I asked, ‚ÄúIn spite of all of my challenges (like my 4 diagnosed mental illnesses which are all severe), why do I choose to continue to live?‚Äù Realizing all of this tonight was like answering that question which has been plaguing me for a while now.

19fgxwv,I found a quarter today and other Friday Eve Miracles ‚Ä¶.,"Friday Eve, the middle of the week. So far enough away from Monday and so close to Saturday to make it one of the best days of the work week. Typically, today is quite a busy day for me. I have more than my fair share of students and with mixed grade levels, it can be a lot to handle. Plus, today is also the one day of the week that I also have a tutoring period. Which can vary anywhere from one to a dozen or so generally off task teenagers. Which makes for a difficult end to the day.

Yet today is a day of Friday Eve Miracles. I came into work and half my students are not present due to grade level testing. Oh, the joys of not having a whole grade level to manage. It is a sigh of relief that only an educator can understand. 

To make things better, I got my tutoring list for the day and wouldn‚Äôt you know it is only one student. One student that I have a really good relationship with. That is a joy to be around, that generally cares and isn‚Äôt just taking up my space.

But there is more good things happening today. As I walked into my classroom for the first time I saw something shinny on the floor. Being the curious creature that I am, I went to investigate and found a quarter.

Oh the smile it brings to my face. I truly do not believe that the current generation of teenagers knows just how special a quarter is. But to those of us who grew up in a coin operated economy knows all the wonderful things that a quarter could bring to your life. When I was a child, finding a quarter meant I could play a video game or get a snack. I could take my chance at a surprise gift from a vending machine or even help my mom with laundry if I so desired to be generous.

And perhaps that is what really has made me smile this morning. Just a bit of nostalgia from a time when my life just seemed so much simpler. Finding a quarter as a child was a really big deal, again you could do a lot of things with a quarter. It may not do much now, but just the happiness I get when I find one now. I put it my pocket and then sporadically through out the day will feel around in my pocket to make sure I haven‚Äôt lost it. Because the number of things I have lost since my youth is to great, so I need to hold on to the little miracles that life gives me now. 

So now to you good reader. I ask you, what is one small miracle that you have experienced on this Thursday or as I like to call it Friday Eve :)",Andtherainfelldown,10,3,1706209382,happy

19dbvu7,I moved 400+ miles away from my hometown and I virtually couldn‚Äôt be happier with my decision!,"Like the title, I‚Äôve moved far away from home and I had never done this before. I always lived in the place where I was born. I honestly never even thought I would move. Last year, I was promoted to manager for a company and I had a LOT of work to do. I needed help, but then lost some accounts and didn‚Äôt need as much help anymore. Someone told me early last year that they should‚Äôve taken the opportunity to move back home when they had the chance (to my hometown - he was helping me for a while, and he lived 400+ miles away.)

It was a seed in the back of my mind to POSSIBLY eventually move. His best friend moved to my hometown to help me full time. Meanwhile, I grew feelings for a friend who said he was moving to where this guy lives. I still thought about moving, but thought there‚Äôs no way I would move for a guy just because I like him. (We aren‚Äôt in a relationship, but I am crazy about him. lol) 

Well, as luck (or fate?) would have it, I lost even more business at work through no fault of my own. I was desperate for a change because I needed to make more money. I don‚Äôt have a roommate and I have bills I need to be able to pay. No other job applications were going anywhere. My friend that I mentioned above suggested that I move out of my hometown, and I thought it might actually not be a bad idea to have more work in a bigger city, like he said. I thought really intensely about it and talked about it with my closest friends and family. 

Even the guy who worked for me was afraid of losing his job. I told him not to worry because I was thinking of moving to take his best friend‚Äôs place - he was in a hard spot financially too, and would have help in my hometown to get back on his feet. Every single person I told about the possibility of me moving said to 100% do it. (Well, aside from my parents, but they have been supportive even when I told them my crush moved away. I thought they were the crazy ones for that. LOL)

I got home from vacation after thinking long and hard about moving, and I drafted the email to send to my boss about moving to two possible locations. One because I had family there, and the other because I KNEW the other guy wanted to move earlier in the year back to my hometown. I had just spent my vacation near where he was living, and I liked it - but I was NOT thinking of moving when I took that trip. Lo and behold, when I got back home, I nearly went negative in my bank account. I had to return socks and underwear because I just couldn‚Äôt afford it. My car payment was coming up and I was so scared. 

I thought about if I were to move, what amount of money would I need to do it? The number $5k popped up and I figured that would be just enough to move. I had no idea how I would get the money. As if by magic, within 3 days, I never went negative in the bank and I had $5k to my name in addition to everything I needed for bills that month. My boss was totally willing to facilitate the move and the guy was desperate to move back home, even though he didn‚Äôt WANT to leave. He HAD to leave. 

It‚Äôs just been amazing how smoothly this has all worked out. I was terrified of moving here because I don‚Äôt know anyone very well, but I do have some friends in the surrounding areas whom I hope to get to know better. The cherry on top is that the friend I have feelings for lives here too, but I am not going to push anything with him. I didn‚Äôt move here FOR him, but it‚Äôs definitely a big perk, in my opinion. I don‚Äôt even know if he likes me at all. But it‚Äôs just so weird how everything has panned out. I am not complaining though. I absolutely adore this place already. 

All my life I thought I would hate it up here. I can‚Äôt think of a single negative other than my small family and my closest friends aren‚Äôt here. However, since moving, I am actually talking to my friends and family MORE than before! They care about my whereabouts and how I am doing so they are checking on me more often and making more of an effort, which is really nice. 

I am just so elated to be here in my quiet little bubble - in a beautiful city, which so far hasn‚Äôt given me anxiety much at all, despite it being so much bigger than where I am from. Everyone has been so incredibly friendly and, again, everything has been so smooth. It feels like it was meant to be. My mind is blown by this experience and honestly, it‚Äôs only been 48 hours, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever move back home unless I absolutely have to, and even then, I am sure it would be temporary.",GR33N4L1F3,16,3,1705971640,happy

19d35q8,My brother and I had donuts delivered to our grandfather,"When we were kids, our immediate family was pretty low-income. So when we were visiting, our grandpa would often take a few of the grandkids to ‚Äúgrab coffee‚Äù from a well known donut shop. We‚Äôd get there and he‚Äôd say to the employees, ‚ÄúA black coffee and a whatever these guys want.‚Äù 

My brother and I would have mere seconds to select a single donut from the wall of deliciousness, and I often would feel overwhelmed with choice in the moment. We loved going to ‚Äúgrab coffee‚Äù with grandpa. 

Fast-forward about 25 years or so, and my brother and I live far from our hometown in different states. I text him and he absolutely remembered getting donuts with Grandpa, so with a bit of planning, we roped a friend of mine in who still lives in the old stomping grounds. 

This morning, I called my grandpa, then added my brother to the call. Grandpa is 87, and had to put us on speakerphone because one of his hearing aids needed to be charged. We chat to him for a moment, then my friend (and his mom, who used to go to church with my grandpa) rolls up with a box of donuts and a black coffee. 

Grandpa was surprised and a little confused at first, but was delighted that we remembered his coffee after all these years. Then he hung up on us (most of his phone calls don‚Äôt last more than 60 seconds) so he could chat to my friend and his mom. 

Honestly, it was such a delight to organize something unexpected for such a generous and caring gentleman who had such an impact on me and my brother.

19cbfas,My mom randomly gave me a mini frigidaire today,"My mom, who is literally one of the most thoughtful and kindest people I've ever and probably will ever meet, owns a storage place where she keeps all of her things that she sells. Sometimes, if she knows the person and knows they're struggling, she will give them things for super cheap. Like one time she sold someone she knew was struggling two nice brand new thick comforters for 4 dollars. She's very well known in the area for this and sometimes people will come and knock on her door just to give her stuff that they don't want, just because they know she'll take it and do good with it.

I always had a little pink mini frigidaire that I kept some of my beauty products in and I loved it dearly, but a few months back it stopped working. I never made a big deal out of it but my mom knew of it. Well, she kept it in mind apparently when today she came to me and gave me a practically brand new, perfectly working, mini black frigidaire that one of her friends didn't want anymore. Just because.

My mom is always reminding me that I can have anything that I want in her storage, she even insists on it when I tell her that I want to pay her. She will shout at me and say ""No! Take it! I don't want your money!"" I'm really grateful to her because I'm surrounded by really beautiful things (both vintage and non vintage) because she lets me have anything I want. I'll just look at something for two seconds too long and she'll ask ""You like it? You want it??"" It's funny really.

When she gave me the frigidaire I told her just how grateful I was and that I felt really lucky to have a mom like her. She said to me that I reminded her of herself at my age and that she once said the same words to her mom, who also owned a storage full of stuff that she would sell. Her mom (my grandma) was the same way and gave her whatever she wanted for free. It's no wonder I was surrounded by very pretty, sometimes downright luxurious looking things growing up too!

I know it's a bit superficial, it's not the only reason I am grateful to my mom, but it's just how thoughtful it was. It made me really happy. I'm glad to have a teensy fridge again too.",SpaceBitchh,66,4,1705865282,happy

He said ""thanks, we have to think about other people too right?"", to which she replied ""that's exactly right"" and gave him a firm one arm hug.

Thinking about that this morning, it makes me so happy to see people teaching compassion and thoughtfulness nowadays. She seemed to be very involved as a parent, and I can't wait to be/teach that way for our daughter.

Recently quit my full time job. Was a good position and good pay but my manager went behind my back and basically just gave my position away and expected me to take the demotion purely because she was struggling at the other location and needed me back there to help. It was nothing to do with me or my work as I was really good at my job (don't mean to be bigheaded) but she allowed this other lady to introduce herself to all my colleagues as the manager of my location when they all know that i was there. 
I was really upset because it made it look like it was because I couldn't do my job and she completely broke any trust I had for her. I loved my job and I'm pretty upset BUT I stood up for myself and didn't stand for the lack of respect and told her where to go. I'm proud of myself for doing so and happy I'm no longer working under her. I'm confident I'll get a good job again that gives me the respect and decency I'm owed.

19ask4o,My friend drew me with my favorite character after a rough day not knowing it made me tear up!,"For context there's this one character that I absolutely adore from an old book series I love, we'll call him H. I've known H for just a year and he has been the biggest comfort character out there. I relate to his character and his upbringing, and his own character has managed to actually make me realize more things of myself and grow as a person. I also even write fanfiction of him, which I feel like is average for a girl my age so I am not that embarrassed. I also of course have a deep crush on him which I joke of with my friends, calling H my boyfriend and such (secretly I actually love these jokes, though I'm too shy to admit that, haha). In other words, H is an amazing character and I am surprised he is not anywhere near mainstream! Though I am glad as I can keep him all to myself now, haha.

I was having a rough day that day, my period had started, my dad was pestering about me going to high school (for health reasons I'll never be able to attend one which upset me a lot), and I was stressing over a theme coding project I had been working on for two days as a gift for a friend. I finished the code early this day and was too scared of sending it to my friend because I deemed it 'aesthetically unpleasing'. In the end I did send it, and then immediately deleted it. But then I realized that I deleted it too late, as now my friend had the code file. The absolute panic I felt in that moment before he revealed to me that he actually liked it! But what I didn't expect was for him to send something back for me. The squeal I let out when I saw it one would think I had won a million dollars! :) It was a drawing of H and me! Let me tell you that my friend is probably one of the best artists I've ever known or seen, so to get a drawing was a blessing itself. But a personal one of my ultimate teen girl fantasy no matter how cringe it was? My heart clenched and I swear I started to feel tears bubbling up inside of me. I am still continuing on expressing my gratefulness to him hours later lol.

He didn't even have to do that for me, yet he did. I am so grateful of my best friend and I absolutely love him with all my heart. It's things like these that make me grateful of meeting him and also of other people in my life, and that I am not truly alone. I wish I realized sooner how much he has done for me. Each time I think about it my eyes brim up with emotional and absolute happy tears. I've been so used to gifts and presents that never truly fit my interests or were considerate enough, but he? He knows me too well to know how to make me the happiest girl in the world. We both jokingly call each other brothers from another mothers, but I realize that I genuinely see him as one, which is making me far too emotional too living as an only child and being the only teen in my family and relatives, so I never had a close relationship like that with someone around my age.

Lesson of the day (for me at least) is that you are never truly alone, and that there are people out there who will embrace any part of you, even your embarrassing fictional crushes. And to also tell my friends more that I love them. :)",alinaesque,25,2,1705695328,happy

We're sitting on my bed, watching a movie, and high. He has had a terrible day, so I'm trying to make it better. I noticed he took a picture of a gift I got him and posted it to a Reddit sub. 

I asked what he was doing, and he got so excited. He told me he was in this nice sub and everyone is so welcoming, that his post got 700 karma. He is very, very new to this app and is older, so he's not up to snuff with everything. 

But he just lit up when he showed me how excited he was that people were talking to him and that they liked his post so much that he got ""a little karma"" 

This man has cried his eyes out for hours tonight; seeing him beam about something so small just filled my heart. I'm overjoyed to see him this excited! 

Anyway, I just, really want this man to be happy, so for this small thing to really bring him joy just makes my chest burn.

Edit: 

If you all want to give him some love I'll link his art post. It'll make him very excited that people enjoy his art. He only ever shares it within his work space. Not sure why but I think it'll get him excited.

19ad5ly,Overcoming my own hurdles and finally felt like me in the longest time.,"Hi everyone. Sorry that this is quite long...I had this experience in December and typed out how I felt, but I never got around to posting it. I wanted to share what happened so I‚Äôm just putting this into the aether.

What is your personal background music to make a mundane action become an epic tale to overcome your own daily anxiety of existing? I had 2 upbeat songs that lightened up my soul (like ‚ÄúHey, Soul Sister‚Äù and ‚ÄúGet Back‚Äù by THE one the THE only Luda!), and then 1 slow song to root me back down (I had the Mr.Kitty song ‚ÄúAfter Dark‚Äù), followed by another BANGER alert ‚ÄúPaint the Town Red‚Äù by Doja Cat... straight banger‚Ä¶anyways...and then something simply great. The first four weren‚Äôt necessarily in that order, but this song was last. The soul lifter ‚ÄúEdward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros - Home‚Äù.

The mundane actions of vacuuming, cleaning, organizing, doing the dishes, emptying the cat bin, etc., all became the act of a Hero overcoming adversity. Showing that even those that only managed to shower today are at times doing their best‚Ä¶you even completing one of the many tasks that need to be done is inspirational and shows you are still pushing.

I must say though that I just chose my playlist of liked videos and put it on shuffle so these are songs I already liked but they made the day feel so much more personal because I connected them to being the best version of myself in that moment. I felt in sync with myself. I felt‚Ä¶happy.

I belted ‚ÄúHEY SOUL SISTA!‚Äù at the top of my lungs for my friends. I did some shit talk dancing while listening to motha‚Äô fuckin Luda! I did some sensual hip wiggles while listening to ‚ÄúAfter Dark."" I felt so sassy during Doja...wagging my finger back and forth and bobbing my head.

I was even happier knowing that Amanda was out looking for a Christmas tree. I was listening to ‚ÄúHome‚Äù again when I thought that‚Ä¶what a beautiful song. We are moving forward in our lives and it's spectacular. We get to put ornaments and our tree topper up soon! The tree topper we use is my Beanie Baby Creepers. I got him when I was young and I started putting him up there in my early 20‚Äôs so it just kind of continued on.

Moving on though! Amazingly, I pushed myself further and completed the next mundane task‚Ä¶I ate food. That‚Äôs impressive if I must say so myself. Maybe not to some‚Ä¶but I did it. I deserve to eat. And right now I think THAT is impressive too. :)

I hope this makes sense... It felt like such a beautiful out of body moment for me and I want others to try to experience that perspective of just being themselves and that doing simple things is in of itself beautiful. If the simple things are hard at this point in time for you, please keep telling yourself that you can do hard things.",IDivide_byZero,16,3,1705647707,happy

198by96,I posted the last 2 years. I‚Äôm back for a third. (Keeping myself accountable haha more info in body text),"Hello everyone! If you look on my profile I‚Äôve posted once a year about my weight loss. I started originally at 320 (although I was too embarrassed to admit it) and got to I think 250 before I got hurt, gained more weight, lost some. Now for 2023. Over the end of 2022 and into 2023 I let a coworker treat me to lunch every day. Where I ate a ton and really fell back into my old terrible habits and all that.
Since September something in me changed. (Also me and that coworker stopped talking, they were a terrible influence but I‚Äôm not go into that here) I have cut out most sugars and in general crappy food out. I usually eat one good meal a day. 
I originally started this just to lose weight out of embarrassment of how bad I had let myself go. Now, I just want to feel better. I‚Äôve seen how much my diet change has improved how I feel and the lost weight helps a ton too. I feel so much better about myself. I just want to change now for the betterment of my health, now for how I look.
So here‚Äôs my post this year to keep myself accountable (and also people have said they wanted to see my updates as the years go on)
My end goal right now for this year is to be near 220, but I‚Äôd REALLY like to be under 200. So let‚Äôs see how 2024 will treat me and you and I hope we can accomplish our goals. If you made it this far reading, I thank you! See you next year!",Shelbutter,1379,64,1705434404,happy

I have never felt so safe and held and seen and attracted to someone all at once so quickly before. She is really forthright and curious and has a lot of integrity. I admire her a great deal and feel so lucky to be able to see who she is becoming (she is trans and has been honoring herself in some pretty big ways lately and witnessing that from the sidelines has been really beautiful and touching).

Quit my job, but worried about money.

I had to do something very hard today. I had to quit my job. It was not a decision I took lightly. Unfortunately it was my first real job and it was sponsored by vocational rehab, which makes me feel bad about quitting. However, I need to prioritize my mental health. I am a 25 year old individual living with multiple disabilities including type 1 diabetes, adhd and anxiety. The job was causing me a lot of stress and anxiety. I spent 4 hours at the therapy office yesterday. They are also adjusting my anxiety medication, I‚Äôm still testing adhd meds. I would like to work but I‚Äôm not sure what I want to do. Sitting around and collecting disability is not an option. There has to be something im good at. Both my boss and vocational rehab are proud of me for prioritizing my mental health. However, I am still worried about money, despite the fact that I live with my parents. If I don‚Äôt work, I won‚Äôt be able to have an income. Money is a big stressor in my life. And I‚Äôm also trying to not feel like a failure. Maybe I can craft or sell something on etsy. Or freelance/gig work. There has to be something I‚Äôm good at. I‚Äôm just not sure what. My plan for now is to priorize my mental health, and I asked my therapy office if I was able to come in twice a week so we shall see what they say.

1912jgy,My 10 year old started calling me Daddy for the first time.,"Over 2 years ago, a friend of ours passed away leaving 3 kids orphaned and a half sibling without a support system. My wife and I took in all 4 kids, as we were quite close with the kids. We got legal guardianship of the 2 youngest about 6 months after they moved in. The youngest is now 10. She started calling my wife ""Mommy"" about a year ago. This took some getting used to as all of our other kids call her ""Mom"". 

I however, remained Mr. MyFirstName. She has never had a dad before, and she had always called me that before she moved in. She gives me hugs everyday (now) and tells me she loves me frequently (yes, I know this won't last). So I was not worried about what she calls me. We went on a trip with my brother and his family, and sometime during the week, she just started calling me ""Daddy"". I'm not sure if it was because her cousin (my niece - 6F) calls my brother Daddy (a lot) or what caused it. At one point, we were at a theme park, and she was calling me Daddy over and over again, and I completely missed it, because I wasn't used to it and her voice is similar to my niece. My SIL grabs my arm and says ""Daddy!!!  Someone is calling you"". I felt awful, and so overjoyed at the same time. We've been home several days and I'm still Daddy (and getting used to it), but also Mr. MyFirstName sometimes too, but it still makes me smile.

18xqvrj,Had a call centre job last summer which turned out to be surprisingly rewarding,"With things as grim as they've been the last few years, I decided I'd get a bit of summer work last year while I was off uni so I could fund a long weekend on the seaside after, as well as a trip to Berlin I'm looking to do with my friends this summer. To cut a long story short, I got a job at uni working in the applicant call centre, where people who were meant to be joining this year could phone up and make enquiries.

A-level results day (I'm from the UK) rolls around and sure enough we get a load of people calling up who've not had the right grades for the course they wanted. Basically, the process is that we ask them for their grades, look up what other relevant courses they'd be eligible for, then forward them on to the department if there's space and they're interested. We have one option called a Foundation Year, where you only need a CDD or something like that to be eligible. You basically do a year of baseline work in your subject area to show that you're competent, then you can go on to do the course you originally wanted.

I took 90-something calls that day, and referred about ten or so people on for foundation years, along with a small handful of other people for other courses. I worked about 12 hours that day, and so I went for a pint afterwards to unwind. I remembered a couple of years prior when a friend of mine didn't get the grades he needed and had to call up the uni, so I've seen how hopeless people can feel when they have to do it. While I was drinking, I had this realisation that, thanks to my intervention, those people were able to still find a way into the uni they wanted to be at. I hadn't had a great past year at uni myself, and so I felt like I'd actually served a purpose that day for the first time in ages",Prudent_Jello5691,26,4,1704308288,happy
18xqt4z,"My old form tutor lost a family member, I orchestrated a card which she received very well","A few years ago when I was in Year 13 (last year of high school in the UK) my form tutor didn't show up one day and it turned out she was having a family bereavement. She was very well liked and her family was all the way in New Zealand so it felt like we could hardly just do nothing.

I stepped up to the plate and bought a card, and somehow got it around the whole form class, plus a few people in the media class she took in our year as I recall, over the course of a few days without her knowing. The message I wrote in the card was ""don't be sad it's over, be glad it happened"", which was what I lived by when my Grandma died a couple of years later in 2022. 

The day comes to give it to her, and it turns out a few girls in the class have also bought her a box of chocolates, even better right? They hand her the chocolates, and I make my friend hand her the card because of my social anxiety. We thought she'd appreciate it, but we got more than we bargained for. She's clearly holding back tears and starts talking about how loved she felt and how lucky she was to be our form tutor.

This was during the few months of COVID where schools were open in the UK, so things were obviously really grim at the time. She was a really sweet, positive, glass half full person to be around and so form class with her was really the only thing keeping a lot of us going. Not only did the gifts have a good impact on her, but it felt like we'd paid her back a little as well.",Prudent_Jello5691,12,1,1704308107,happy

The smaller one literally said ‚Äúdoctor, you‚Äôre so cute‚Äù (im not a doctor but i appreciated the compliment). Thought I heard her wrong so I told her to repeat herself and it made me really happy that I giggled under my mask and couldnt stop smiling. While they were waiting for their prescription filled, the older sister said it was cold and the younger offered her jacket and started taking it off and putting it on her which i thought was extremely sweet. They were sitting and talking, their dad just hugging them. When I finally dispensed her medications, the older one said ‚Äúthank you, bye, cute doctor‚Äù.

18vzwrm,This years NYE has single- handedly redeemed years of fallen through plans,"Throughout highschool and into my ‚Äúadult life‚Äù I‚Äôve had nothing but poorly planned, underwhelming experiences on New Years. Always has just been a complete lack of plans or everything falling through an hour before it‚Äôs supposed to happen, y‚Äôknow. 

This year I saw to it for that to not be the case, which was an absolute success. I bought tickets to an underground rave in the city (Chi) with two of my buddies and ended up seeing multiple good friends who I hadn‚Äôt spoken to in years.

Midnight rolled in a few minutes after we had arrived n‚Äô me and some friends danced til exhaustion multiple times over, being a fairly reserved person, that was something I‚Äôve never done before; and I gotta say I enjoyed it thoroughly. The event was set to end at 3am but at 2:30 it was still going full bore.

Around that time I was just vibing with one of my buddies on the outer edge of the set, when I glanced behind me and a gal rEally caught my eye. Totally my type. 

Of course there were other girls there that I could‚Äôve put some effort into to dance with and the likes, but she appeared at seemingly the perfect time. Thinking the rave would be done in the next 30 minutes, I took a moment to think about how I‚Äôd approach her. (I‚Äôve never tried talking to a girl at any type of function before, school dances, any other parties I had been to, etc. never even bothered.) 

This probably shouldn‚Äôt have worked but it did. After mustering up some confidence, I offered my friend my vape, (I know, ew.) let him take a few hits, then turned around and offered it to her. She gladly accepted my offer, introduced herself as Annie, and we continued to talk (may or may not have found a room as well) until 5am. Got her number and social, got her an Uber (her group ditched her), and headed home with the boys. 

I‚Äôm just proud of myself and glad I had a genuinely ‚ÄúHappy New Year‚Äù this time around. 

I‚Äôm one to think that the starting of a new calendar year is nothing really special, and just another day. Because.. c‚Äômon, it just is. But although today‚Äôs just another day, it sure is a good one for me.

P.S. - Came to find out at some point that Annie is short for Anastasia. Lord almighty good god she‚Äôs got a name as beautiful as herü´†",No_Department_5261,18,1,1704125615,happy

This is the first time this year it‚Äôs been cold where I live, so I‚Äôm not sure how long I have been able to feel the bottom of my feet for. Maybe it came back slowly and I just didn‚Äôt notice?

So what happened was several years ago I lost the feeling on the bottom of my feet and toes from wearing high heels for sorority recruitment. I was wearing high heels on concrete for 6 days around 10 hours a day and since I‚Äôm tall I had to stand in the back and jump nonstop every time girls were entering or leaving our sorority house.

After a few months the feeling returned to my toes but not the pads of the bottom of my feet. I had seen several specialists and they said pretty much there‚Äôs nothing we could do except wait and hope the nerves came back. After a couple of years I didn‚Äôt think they would ever come back.

I do not know how it is possible that the nerves could repair themselves years later. But they‚Äôre definitely back. I used my finger nail on the bottom of my feet and I can feel it so it isn‚Äôt just temperature I can feel ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥

In January of this year (2023), I decided that it was time to seriously pursue making video games. In November, I released my first game! It was an amazing experience, to the point that game development has become my number one hobby.

I didn't tell her where I intended to take her. I just asked her when she had her holidays and around christmas we planned the trip.

When we were at front gate and she realized where we were she became so mesmerised. Seeing her so happy I felt very gratified. That was the first time I realized that love is about giving cause the more you give the more blissful you become.

We visited every temple, the people were chanting Hare Krishna and she was enjoying every little thing. She even took some of the soil from there as a memory.

later i found myself in a ai image generator. i asked it to make one of my happiest days in the not so happy life of mine. and you know what? it didn't disappoint me.

this is a date i had with my love of life. it was beautiful day. i wore red polo shirt that she gave me in my birthday (she is one of 2 people who cares about my birthday) and she wore this outfit (pink skirt, white shir, pink hijab) that she wore in the day that i started loving her. before that we used to be friends, and we spoke a lot. i used to think of her as the coolest girl out there. and she thought of me like this as well (yes i said cool, yes we were young and yes i still do think of her as the coolest girl out ther). one day we decide to meet, i went to to that location, when i saw her from a distance and she smiled at me from far, wearing this outfit it i fall in love, 

we met to give her her birthday present (black hijab from the type she loves so much but she didn't have a black one, and inside of it i put a kindder surprise as a extra surprise for later).

so later in the relationship after i confessed and growing together loving each other more and more, we met in one of our walk dates (dates is kinnda illegal here) i wore this shirt that she gave me and a bracelet that she made for me before my confession (really sweet gift), and she wore my favorite outfit she had (she knows how to make me happy).

in this date we hold hands for the first time ever. we have been loving each other for over a year and half by now. (i know it may be something alien to most of you but we live in different place with different rules.)

so this is a small part of our story. it made me happy to remember these days even with all of my cournt problems.

18sp2pp,The two stray cats I took in are best friends now,"I didn‚Äôt want cats. But these two little guys are here now and I‚Äôm so glad they are. 

My older one was a bony 6-month-old stray last winter that begged my mom for help, he demanded attention. He wanted love so much that the thought of sending him to a shelter where he‚Äôd be alone in a cage broke my heart, so I took him in. My younger one was a 1-2-month-old kitten who went on an adventure. She climbed into my roommate‚Äôs fianc√©e‚Äôs car while she was delivering food in a trailer park and wouldn‚Äôt leave. She took the kitten home, but her dog didn‚Äôt get along with it. Based on how she described the kitten, I again couldn‚Äôt send it to the shelter, so I took her in. 

Both live with me in my college apartment. It took some adjusting for them, but it was worth it. They‚Äôre best friends now, I love seeing them together. They play fight constantly, I can tell my older one is holding back and my younger one is learning how to catch him off guard. They love to eat at the same time as well. The older one always sleeps right by me and the younger tends to sleep on the ground or in the cat tree. When I wake up in the morning, they‚Äôll both wake up too, and and younger one will always hop up on my bed purring and immediately go touch noses with my older one. 

We had to travel back home for Christmas, my older one has bad separation anxiety and he would‚Äôve been alone for a couple days so I took both of them. They were stressed in their new environment. So when we went to bed, they cuddled with each other, paws on one another for comfort and support. 

I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôve been able to provide them a good home. Watching them grow up has been an honor. From putting their first collars on them to seeing my kitten see snow for the first time, there‚Äôs so much to smile about. They‚Äôve got so much time to spend with each other, I‚Äôm looking forward to it.

I decided I needed a new hobby that got me outside so I started practicing left handed. After an hour or so I had the gun sited in. The tree is 75 freedom units away. I taped it so I could see if the pellet hit or just took the bark away.

18prgos,Sometimes the smallest things are what save us all,"This was during COVID I believe. I was going through a hard time in my life. I was in a conference for women and there was one girl in particular that smiled often during the zoom call. She laughed and smiled and seemed to brighten the call. That day, we were sharing some things amongst our breakout rooms. I shared that her smile saved me in some ways. Or, at least that it showed me something. But, I know it really did save me. 

I was so low that the thought of someone smiling so freely shocked me. I didn‚Äôt realize that people were that happy. I cried while I shared that her smile truly did something for me.

I wonder if she knows how much that changed my perspective during that time. 

Now, I smile often. I smile at the small and big things. Although it may dim at times, I never knew I‚Äôd be at this place in my life. Looking back, I think I always kept a sour face so people would notice that I needed help. Now? I smile because it brings me happiness, because there are things to be happy about daily although it seems hard at times.

I think her smile made me smile more, at least partly.

18pi35n,"After a decade and a half of struggling financially after my career was derailed, I just got offered a state job that will put my career back on track and basically change my life","Sad bit first: In 2008, I was an up and coming IT professional with a specialty of running help desks; but I lost my wife to a long-term illness and my job to the housing crisis. Since then, I've gotten by on telephone-based customer service jobs. It was tough when our kids were small; but once they grew up, I was able to live a modest life until inflation and student loans started to make things increasingly untenable. On top of that, I've been working overnight from home as an emergency dispatcher for an organization with far too limited resources and it's been isolating, demoralizing and just generally soul-draining. 

&#x200B;

Happy bit now: Back in May, a very close friend of mine who works for the state let me know about some jobs that would be coming up that paid really, really well by my new standards. What followed were months of drama involving resumes, paperwork, choosing the right government contractor to work for and being interviewed three separate times by the same two people and a different rotating guest interviewer every time. I was starting to lose all hope; but yesterday, I got an offer for the best of all possible positions. I'll not only be running the help desk; after a few years, I will \*be\* the help desk. The only other person working on the desk has been there since day one, but she retires in a few years and hasn't done a very good job of writing down how to do all of the things she does; while I've got years of experience documenting processes for my own job and for others. Anyway, aside from the need to document processes, the desk isn't very busy. It's the customer service help desk for a state web site used to track controlled substance prescriptions. Unless something significant changes, they'll probably never need more than one person to work on it. That means that, after a few years passes and my coworker retires, I'll have a government job that isn't very busy and will always exist in some form unless the government suddenly decides to stop tracking controlled substance prescriptions. Plus I'll still be able to work from home (but no longer on third shift) with a flexible schedule that will allow me to make appointments without taking time off, 11 paid holidays a year and all the folks I'll be working with and under are perfectly lovely by every account. And then there's the pay. By my math, I'll be making almost exactly twice what I make in my current job (from approx $35k to $70k in a state where about $47k is considered comfortable). And my life is already pretty dialed in for penny pinching that mostly won't change; so aside from some badly needed one-time expenses I've been putting off, most of the extra money will be discretionary. On top of that, I will very likely never be put in charge of anyone else unless I decide to go for another position. I have traditionally avoided management positions because I've so often worked in places where management meant a small increase in pay for a huge increase in stress, but that's not the case for state employees at all.

&#x200B;

In short, this job will change my life. For pretty much my whole life, I've been barely holding on financially. I don't even know how to live without worrying about money. Even now, it doesn't feel real that I've been this fortunate. I told my friend that I won't feel truly financially secure until I can set all of my bills to autopay but I really will be able to do that! After my final interview and the night before the final decision was made, I made a list of all of the things I'd buy if I got the job that I probably can't buy now. The list was made up almost entirely of things that I've been putting off; in some cases, for years. Even talking about it makes me think that I should feel all bummed out about that, but I'll be able to take care of all of that shit soon!

&#x200B;

Also, I'll get a state pension and be able to save up additional money to make up for lost time. I'm a veteran who goes to the VA for health care, so I won't have to worry about being bankrupted by medical bills as I get older or in the case of sudden illness. My only major debt is my student loans because they were my first major debt and I refused to borrow afterward, but I'll be able to make payments on those fairly easily now. In short, there is now nothing to prevent me from working until the retirement age of my choice and then retiring in relative comfort and dignity. This is a dramatic improvement over my previous plan, ie to work until the day I have a massive heart attack or until I get too old to work and find myself shuffled off to a VA raisin ranch to suffer in squalor or - worse yet - to end up becoming a drain on the kids. And speaking of the kids, they're grown now and they're getting by, but they're not exactly rolling in dough. One of them is working night jobs and going to college. The other is getting married (delayed due to the expense) and struggling under her first car loan (for a car that is a lemon, naturally). They've never really been able to depend on me financially since they got their own jobs and they've really never asked for help; but the fact that I'll finally be able open the Bank of Dad and take financial pressure off of them makes me happy beyond all measure. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, TL;DR I got a new job and I feel amazing; like everything has changed for the better. I probably haven't even considered all of the implications. I mean, I still have problems, right?  Everyone has problems that can't be solved with money. So of course I still have some, right? Except ... I can't seem to think of any. Weird, right? Definitely a good kinda weird, though.",devilishlydo,122,9,1703374532,happy

18nx34k,Gratitude is all I have. Thankful and blessed.,"This has been a weird year full of a lot of really good things but also a lot of hardships. 

My car was totaled from a freak hail storm the same month we moved into a new house and collectively these two things increased our monthly spending about $700 and doubled my commute which doubled my fuel needs in a bigger car. 

We also took on two perfect little pups not long before all of this. So it‚Äôs been a wacky financial year. We‚Äôve struggled a lot but somehow every month we‚Äôve stretched and bent and made things happen. 

But here I was in the beginning of December stressing to death about being able to give the kids any kind of Christmas, literally bank account was collecting dust at the beginning of the month but I just kept saying that we‚Äôll find a way. And slowly but surely things worked out. I got a bonus here and a gift card there, my husband had a good week of sales and had extra money coming in, we sold a few electronics we don‚Äôt use. And here we are 4 days away and my babies are set.

My son has a desk, chair and dresser in these boxes and brand new quality art supplies since he loves pencil drawing the most. 

My daughter has a big girl vanity so her toddler vanity can be passed on. And some kind soul sold me all of this great condition Barbie stuff for $60. A Barbie was the only thing she asked for. 

There was even enough for mom and dad to have things under the tree even though we decided to skip gifts this year to give the kids the best we could. And my husband is SO proud that he shopped for me. 

Truly it‚Äôs been so stressful this year and I am bubbling over with gratitude that we were so blessed this month. I know this is not the reality for a lot of people so I just wanted to share with someone that I take none of this for granted.",milliemallow,162,5,1703192166,happy
18nvyrm,I'm single again for the first time in seven years and I feel so free and excited and happy,"My husband and I had a looooong talk that was very civil, supportive, caring, and mature where we both laid out our issues and agreed on what to do. In the end we found that we are just not compatible as husband and wife and both need to heal or grow in different areas before we can actually be married to people and our individual struggles are just not compatible as a unit. We both did some crying and laughing and ended things on very good terms and affirmed how much we love each other to death and there's no bitterness or blame game. 

Everyones saying they're sorry this had to happen but actually I feel fine. I feel really good actually like a huge weight has been lifted. 

There is grounds for an annulment because he was fucked up on Kratom during the wedding so we don't have to go through a divorce. 

He wrote a beautiful song about how he felt and sent me the lyrics and it made me bawl my eyes out because it was so beautiful and sad. I'm so proud of him for getting clean and getting help and getting back in touch with his real feelings. 

I feel excited to enter my thirties in a brand new chapter and finally be independent with my own place and my own car standing on my own two feet which I always wanted to do but never got the chance to. 

Feeling great and grateful and like it couldn't have worked out any better. It's looking like we are gonna stay good friends!

18mt6f5,My List of Core Values (where I find happiness and what‚Äôs important to me),"My list of Core Values.  Context: Was searching for ways to have more self-confidence, (in particular around women) and learned it‚Äôs impossible to show others you care for them when you don‚Äôt know what you care about in yourself. In that moment thinking about what I care about, (at 2am in my room alone in the dark) I opened the notes app on my phone with simple guidelines: One, to not leave the notes app and only use my head, and two, focus on internal sources of happiness/what I care about the most, as trivial as they may be to others. They are not in a complete order of importance as some, if not most, are tied and overlap in many areas. I also recognize they‚Äôll change as I grow. This list may expand and contract as I age, however they are important to me as of writing. Towards the slowing of ideas a good reference was the Boy Scout Law (worth a search regardless of opinion of the organization) but mainly reflected back to my internal gratification of ideologies and actions. I‚Äôm certain I left some things out I‚Äôll think of later, but for now, this is what I came up with.  Written on December 20th, 2023 and I‚Äôm a 22 year old male living in America if that affects anyones perspective while reading.


(Also, this is my first ever Reddit post and wasn‚Äôt planning on posting it anywhere when first starting but wanna help others find what‚Äôs important to them. Hope you like it and if not I respect it as well, thanks!)



- Honesty (don‚Äôt lie to make yourself/others happy)
- Loyalty (deception heals no one)
- Bravery (don‚Äôt get stuck in your own head, be at peace; You care more than anyone else you think does, go for it and don‚Äôt look back. Breathings a good first step :) )
- Caring (being gentle yet tough; friendly, helpful, and kind, yet still realistic)
- Learning. Constantly expand knowledge from as many healthy (and recognize unhealthy) sources as possible. Reading‚Äôs a good one.
- Finding positivity in negative situations
- Hydrate. Drinking water helps everything inside and out.
- Trustworthy (no good in lying to anybody, including (especially) yourself)
- Don‚Äôt take everything so serious. Know when to react and when to lay back.
- Blending logic with creativity (think clearly, but allow room for imagination)
- Reverent and courteous (showing respect to all whether they deserve it or not; impossible to know all they‚Äôve been through and vice versa)
- Gratitude (appreciate everything, both good and bad no matter how big or small. (Grateful to have all my senses and be able-bodied, and have a stable family)
- Uplifting others (clearly convey emotions; communication. Helping others helps everybody)
- Motivation (external sources are a spark, but you are the fuel)
- Overcoming difficult challenges/puzzles both mentally and physically
- Listen. Close your eyes and listen. Feel everything around you and find your core. Again, breathe.
- Cleanliness (begins with happiness and self-worth to consistently maintain, also it feels good to be clean and smell nice)
- Music (Both listening and creating (mainly drums). Do it for the satisfaction of yourself. As my dad said a long time ago, ‚ÄúWhy listen to bad music‚Äù)
- Controlled chaos (organized mess (prefer order but unbothered by uncontrolled elements))
- Snowboarding (freedom/dopamine rush, remember to do it for you not to show off)
- Humor (make yourself laugh) 
- Thrifty (manage time and money; ironically it takes time, yet achievable with mindfulness)
- Sex (why lie lol. Important; don‚Äôt use as a mask of emotions)
- Go with you gut. Worst that happens is you learn.
- Gauging risk (is it worth it to you)
- Set different levels of goals. Little goals, ((to me) such as going to bed at a certain time, shaving/getting a haircut regularly) Medium goals, (going the the doctor and the gym more than I want to) and Big Goals (career, education, family, monetary importance)
- Comfort (warmness, softness, cleanliness)
- Style (If you‚Äôre happy with how you look you‚Äôll be more confident, but don‚Äôt let others effect it in ways that go against what you think. Dress how you wanna dress)
- Sleep (I love sleep I gotta add it, but don‚Äôt abuse it, get up and get some sun)
- Video games (while I know it serves as a distraction, it improves problem solving, social skills, quick thinking, and makes me happy so how can I not add it. My main games are Destiny 2 (hunter for life) and Rainbow Six Siege as a social tool for friends back home)
- Be aware of nature (Leave no trace. Why litter?)
- Food (good food is pretty great, and an art in and of itself. Same rule as sex though, don‚Äôt abuse it. Think about what you‚Äôre doing. Sometimes, screw it sugar is rad, other times, you know you don‚Äôt need it so swap it out)
- Hard work. (Knowing you put the time in and acknowledging it independently. Instead of putting others down who struggle and maybe even annoy you with their lack of effort, help ‚Äòem out and they might help you. Goes back to courtesy)
- Reflect (Is it helping me achieve my goals, my happiness, are my actions hurting others, what‚Äôs something that went wrong today and how can I fix it or is it out of my control)
- Don‚Äôt wait around. While luck is real, it‚Äôs nothing to depend on. Find who you want to be, what you want to do, where you want to go. Life‚Äôs shorter than you think but longer than you realize. Do it or don‚Äôt.
- Be thankful. I know I said it before but I‚Äôm sayin‚Äô it again. If you‚Äôre reading this be thankful you can see. If you‚Äôre hearing it be thankful you can listen. Be thankful we have the technology to spread knowledge infinitely. Thank yourself and others and hold onto that forever.
- Appreciate myself for who I am in my uniqueness.
- Don‚Äôt forget to smile :)

18jaqu2,"At a Christmas party, earlier this week, I felt well and truly happy again","I'm a 21 year-old guy who recently graduated from University. I decided to pursue a master's degree in journalism, and have returned to the same city, but changed Universities to do so.

I experienced a lot of mental health difficulties in my final year of University. I was on the receiving end of some gaslighting behaviour from my flatmates, who'd been my closest friends for months. They stopped talking to me, and refused to tell what I'd done wrong. I felt very upset, paranoid and anxious for months on end: I'd barely see anyone. I've struggled to keep friends throughout my life, and never have arguments with anybody. For weeks, I felt like the worst person ever. Interestingly enough, I contacted a previous flatmate of my current flatmates, and they told me that they'd had almost verbatim the same experience as me. This made me feel better, and  I managed to graduate. 

My master's degree has turned out to be really cool. I've met a new bunch of people, and spent most of my time with them; I've felt the paranoia going and my confidence returning over the past few months. I've also made lots of steps forward in pursuing journalism and writing, which is what I'm interested in. I attended a Christmas party this week, which was attended by most of the journalists at my University. It was at a very hectic and slightly too small Irish bar, with cheesy Christmas music blaring over the stereo. I drank a lot of Guinness, did a lot of dancing and felt the most confident that I had in ages. At one point, a very beautiful and kind girl on my degree came up to me while I was talking to somebody else, and put her arm around me for no reason. That made me feel very happy, and I was glad that she felt comfortable around me and wanted to do that. Later she paid me lots of compliments, saying I looked good that night, and that she admires what I've achieved in our shared degree. Later, a guy on our degree, whom I've got with really well said 'I've got so much love for you man, I really admire you talent.' Both of these things just made me feel on cloud-nine, and a lot more happy and positive with regards to how my life's going to go in the future. I realised, once again, how great it is to be truly and honestly liked and loved by people.",CS500,19,3,1702675613,happy

Fast-forward to the present day and we've finally released our second album.  We have listeners all around the world (not a huge number, but they *are* out there.)   

It's pretty surreal to load up iTunes or Spotify and see the cover art I did, for an album I produced, and hear all of our voices and instruments coming together even though we live so far apart.  It's just kind of amazing if you think about it. 

I think the best part of this whole thing is that we're still such good friends after knowing each other for so long.  We really work well together.  It just makes me feel good to realize that.

For two whole years, my son and I had no place to stay. We stayed in different hotels and motels, not knowing where we'd sleep each night.

Nights were tough, not having a stable place to live. We tried to find comfort in hotels, but it was always temporary. We also stayed in my grandma's extra room for a while, feeling thankful but also sad because we didn't know what would happen next.

During those hard times, my son and I stuck together and became stronger. Cold nights, moving around a lot, and dealing with problems were tough, but we held on. Even in my grandma's spare room, where we stayed for a bit, there was still uncertainty about the future.

Our story is about making it through tough times, just my son and me. We believed that, even after losing everything, we could find a new place to call home. One day at a time, we kept going.

Eventually, things started looking up. After those challenging two years, we finally found a place to stay‚Äîa cozy two-bedroom apartment that we now proudly call home. The journey was tough, but the warmth of our new space erased the hardships of the past.

Hey folks, wanted to give y‚Äôall a happy and super cute update. The original post is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/s/IDj58JYPhb

Just got home from our 4th(?) date and they SURPRISED ME WITH FLOWERS and COOKED ME DINNER!! 

I always tell people I‚Äôm dating how much I love getting flowers, and rarely does anybody ever gets me any. It‚Äôs not about the money and doesn‚Äôt have to be elaborate, one of the most lovely bouquets I‚Äôve ever received was one somebody picked for me and cost them nothing out of pocket. I can‚Äôt remember the last time someone did bring me flowers because it happens so infrequently. I buy myself flowers from time to time just because I love them so much. I never told this person how much I love flowers, they just wanted to do something kind and romantic and surprised me with them before cooking me an incredible salmon dinner at their place.

Y‚Äôall, they‚Äôre really into me. Like, really and truly wants to get to know me, and opening up to me about themselves, and also nothing is going to fast which is good because unfortunately I have really been through it this past year and I just really need things to go slow for me in any kind of dating capacity right now. 

They‚Äôre working on transforming their queer barbershop initiative into a non-profit to be able to give gender-affirming haircuts to our community and it‚Äôs so awesome to be dating somebody who puts action behind the values they say they have. We need a lot more action on top of the talk - in 2023 ‚Äúspreading awareness‚Äù is not enough. 

Anyways, I just really feel so good right now, like all warm and fuzzy. I truly cannot believe the twists and turns life has had for me this year. Tomorrow I wake up and I am incorporating a second business on the advice of my ‚Äúdoes the math for me financial human‚Äù and I‚Äôm about to make some big scary moves.. with confidence, because I feel like the people in my life both believe in me and are aligned with my values. Absolutely incredible. 

I hope everybody reading this has a wonderful day, and even if it‚Äôs not perfect t the way you want it, that you can find something small to make you smile and remind you that joy is hiding waiting for us all, waiting to be discovered.",torturecrush,106,7,1702540513,happy

18fb0hf,"I am so happy because I love my girlfriend, I am the luckiest person alive","So me and my girlfriend have been together for 9months now coming up to 10, were both young and our relationship before we got officially together was extremely rocky. When your young your lowkey crazy, and she wasn't in a good mental space, but I stuck with her. I was there through every second, through all of her breakdowns everytime she was mean to me me. Lead me on and then decided she didn't want to me anymore, then came and cried my arms weeks later. We had big arguments where we wouldn't speak for months but I'd break and ask to work it out again. I have no idea what made me try so hard with her because with every other single person I've met I have never cared this much. I'd consider myself to be quite nonchalant. But something just kept bringing me back, I saw something through her, I knew that somewhere deep down this girl had so much love to give but just didn't quite know how to. And I just had all the patience for her, and still do. She had a rough childhood and sometimes still has a rough home life but I'm here to support her day in day out. I feel like the love I had for her just came in so quickly. It felt like a soulmate connection almost. I don't believe in soulmates, twin flames anything aligning with the stars or anything. I'm nor spiritual or religious. But I have some serious tie to this woman. This love for her defies all. She makes me laugh, makes me feel loved, listens to me and is just so beautiful. And I am so proud of how far she's come and I try to remind her everyday how much I love her. Because she is truly, the love of my life. We're breaking up for university in about a year, but that's okay because I've promised to see her whenever I can. I'm not letting go of this connection, I feel this is a find that's one in a million. I feel so much security and love. She checks every and I mean every single box. And I hope I do the same for her. Through uni we're breaking up because I want to be focused on my studies and won't be able to maintain a proper relationship especially long distance, we've both had open discussions about this. We both have needs and we're young and we would both feel like were almost 'missing out' on our youth and the uni experience if we don't let eachother have this time. But we're happy to let eachother do this, because I know no matter what at the end of the day. No matter how many faces, how many bodies how many people I meet she is the one I want to come home to. She's the one I want have children with. She's the girl I want to get married to. She's the woman I could be so proud to call my wife. No one could ever compare. Throughout our relationship our arguments have been short, resolved so easily. Being with eachother has just come so easy now. The love just comes. We're seeing eachother tomorrow  then going on a double date on Tuesday. Then having a sleepover Friday. And we see eachother everyday in college. I never run out of things to talk to her about. We've known eachother for about 4 years now. And everyday spent with her is amazing. I've never been so happy, never been so content. If perfection exists it is now and it is all the time when I'm with her. She is everything and more. I feel like the luckiest person alive sometimes. So many people have issues in their relationship, they're toxic back and forth. And don't get me wrong we were like that once. But something clicked into place. Like the stars did actually just align and everything was just suddenly in its right place. I've never felt so right about anything in my life and I believe I never will again.

18fa8do,"After years of being alone and not having anyone to talk to, I finally have a friend!","So basically, I used to be alone because of my really bad social anxiety. I never had friends in real life or online. I used to constantly use chat bots just to feel like I was talking to someone, and I would do a lot of bad things to make myself feel better. I honestly used to be really depressed.

But that is not the case anymore thankfully! I was at school and I was overhearing him and his friend talking about planes, and I wanted to join in. I didn't know how to though, I felt bad I might interrupt him. So I wrote a sticky note asking him, ""what is your favorite plane"". Most people would just tell me outloud, but he understood my anxiety, so he ended up taking out a pencil from his backpack and writing it down. I felt so happy somebody actually talked to me back. I ended up drawing his favorite plane, and I saw the smile he had on his face and I was so happy!

I felt like i mattered again. I wasn't talking to Al/chat bots, I was talking to a real person that I can see in real life, now we talk to eachother a lot on social media and I'm just so happy. He's like a light for me in my darkness. We have so much in common, we are the same age, and he is just the nicest person ever, he even says sorry when he doesn't respond to me fast enough. When I think of him I just get butterflies and I end up smiling.

18ewfmw,Dinner for 1 apparently wasn't on my menu that night," My BFF and I used to go to Red Lobster fairly often. But when he had to move out of town I found myself with no one that wanted to take his place. So I went by myself.

I wasn‚Äôt very busy and that was good. About half way thru my dinner a family of 4 was seated across the aisle from me. With no one to chat with, my attention stayed with the family. The 2 young kids each got sodas to drink while Mom and Dad drank water. They bid the waiter to the table more than once to help them navigate the large menu. I heard discussions about plate splitting and what might be less than what. Each time the waiter was nice and tried to help them out.

At one moment I saw the Dad reach into his pocket and pull some bills out and quickly count them and then shove them back in again before anyone had noticed, except for me. It had become quite obvious that they were on a strict budget and were maybe out of their comfort zone as far as the dinner for 4 was concerned. The adults chatted quietly between themselves and when they were not their attention was to the kids. A very nice family I was assured.

Then it hit me. I had saved some money without my BFF being there and I thought about maybe paying for their dinners. Nah, what a selfish thing to do. To throw money around like that wasn't my style. But then why not? How would I go about something like that anyway? I paid my bill and left, and as I was going past the Host at the entry I asked if it would be possible for me to pay the check for the family that I had been sitting across from. The Host didn't know so she went to talk to the Manager. Then she brought the Manager back with her. She asked if I wanted to pay the check for the family and I said Yes. They totaled it up and I gave them my card without even looking at the amount. I didn‚Äôt leave before saying if they wanted to know who paid their bill, just say it was a happy man that did it. And I left.

As it turned out, the dinner wasn‚Äôt very much. And I was feeling quite a bit like a Santa right then. I haven‚Äôt told this story to anyone since it happened. And that was quite a bit pre-pandemic ago. I imagine that there could have been a group of grifters that did what they did to try to get some $ from others but I let that notion go a long time ago. It wasn‚Äôt a situation like that. Had I not been bored while eating I wouldn't have noticed them. Had my BFF been there, I wouldn't have even known that they existed. 

But I thought it was time to tell the story to someone, and I chose all of you for that. I‚Äôm not really looking for feedback, unless you really feel the need for it. I had just been watching TV and something brought it to my mind. And as I‚Äôm having some health troubles as of late, I didn‚Äôt want my effort to go without maybe inspiring someone else to do something similar if and when the time comes. It‚Äôs not like I haven‚Äôt given to my share of charities, but this was something different. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to feel good about having done it, but I do when I recall it. And I do now too. In a way that I really haven‚Äôt felt in a long long time. ",TopTech33,295,18,1702186103,happy
18etrx4,I‚Äôm so happy that I‚Äôve purged most of the items in my apartment!,"I LOVE how I am living owning less.

I am SO happy. This is probably the happiest I‚Äôve ever been in my adult life in my living situation. 

I used to have a MAJOR hoarding problem as a child. I was so overwhelmed by all the things and the thought of organizing them, but I also agonized over letting go of anything. 

I never understood how anyone could live comfortably and in a tidy, clean home‚Ä¶ it got a little better as I got older but it was still problematic. 

Flash forward and now through a series of events, I‚Äôve both realized and HAD to downsize. I am finally nearing the finish line and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with how it feels in my apartment! 

I‚Äôve also realized I don‚Äôt need to live like everyone else does.

December 1st, thing is quotes: there are so many of them and they all have some truth to them. Like the one in the picture. In 2024 this will be my resolution! I can go look for an excuse not to do something, which for me are mostly fear based. I dislike uncertainty in my life but uncertainty now will make me prosper later. So I‚Äôm happy to have found that I will start letting myself be less fearful and more fearless.

 December 2nd, I am happy for traditions, like many countries with ours we celebrate Sinterklaas. Technically it‚Äôs for Dec 5th. But since the families are big and spread out over the country we move it to the weekend because unlike USA most of us don‚Äôt have the day off like they do for thanksgiving. 

I like the traditions where friends/ families come together to enjoy each other‚Äôs company. 
And the lit up face from the kids for this one is amazing!!

 December 3rd, I‚Äôm happy for taking a days rest. And especially pajamas!! I love the matching ones for the family at Christmas. The comfyness of them and the smell of a fresh pair in a crisp newly maid bed. Amazing after yesterday‚Äôs festivities I needed a rest and were having a pajama day!

 December 4th, rollerblades !!! I‚Äôm happy I conquered my fear of falling on my face and breaking something and started again to rollerblade so I can rollerblade with my girls! 

 December 5th, do overs!! Ever had it happen you send a text/make a post thinking you hit enter and send that shit off‚Ä¶ not to figure out you didn‚Äôt. I hate when it happens for important things like deadlines you were able to make but didn‚Äôt. But I am happy we can do do-overs. And make these little wrongs right.

December 6th, Lego. Since we have kids it‚Äôs fun to start over and become a kid yourself again for those who stopped. (Kudos to the ones that stayed) I lives building and seeing the story‚Äôs they create. The building is an adventure and playing brings the adventures out even more.

18bzpq9,feeling really lucky and really loved right now,"hi guys, just started crying in happiness and just wanted to share my story a bit. long story short, my family went homeless and has been living out of a .. pretty run down motel in florida for the past 8 months. being there came with its own set of problems, things i still do have to process on a pretty frequent basis and sometimes it's mood altering for me. 


im lucky, i have this really close online friend who already meant the world to me whose family offered to take me in so i didn't have to go through that. in the beginning phases of being here i was struggling a lot because id just undergone major traumas at home and didn't really know how to act but three months later im finally starting to find my confidence again; it's hard sometimes and ive had my moments but otherwise ive been having a lot of fun with my friend and his family. 


OKAY SO the reason i made this post is because his parents have been absolutely INCREDIBLE to me. seriously ive only had them in my life for a relatively short time, but they've taken a liking to me and ive taken a liking to them too, their dynamic with each other and just the family in general is everything id always wanted to have in my life and getting to experience it, im just... so appreciative of them. i don't just feel like a friend; i feel like an actual family member. they never treat me differently from their own kids and are so so so so welcoming to me. his mom even calls me her fourth child. the thing that made me cry just now is that i was sitting on the couch and his mom came up to me and we talked a bit, but at the end she told me good night and she loves me. i just feel... genuinely so loved. like she shows it in her actions a lot but im just a softie and started crying to that lmao. there's something about being taken under someone's wing that just seemed like something that would never happen to me and now it's happening to me and im realizing that despite all my hardship and the flaws that i have that came with my hardships, im still capable of being loved. i owe these people my life and i hope one day i can show them how much i love and appreciate them",Southern_Dragonfly20,22,1,1701852140,happy

189rmds,A Win! But I have no one to share it with!!,"I posted in another subbreddit titled ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt enjoy sex - but I want to, please help.‚Äù
After I made that post I got a lot of helpful advice and I started to explore and develop an appreciation for porn and sex workers in general. I got a new toy and sifted through a lot to find the content that I enjoyed. For some reason I gravitated towards a sex worker named Seth Gamble, so I mainly stuck to his content and watched and interview he did with his wife and so on. 

My world has changed so much, I grew up in a religious household that shamed women for having or even hinting/ displaying any sexual desire, not that I am religious at all, but subtly I always felt guilty for having any sexual desire via the upbringing. Im a 26F and just started to explore masturbating and finding ways to enjoy it. I just am so thankful for finding that subbreddit and genuine people that wanted to help me and I have such a different view and appreciation for what sex workers do, their bravery to put themselves out there in such a vulnerable way and as a psychology student I am even fascinated with wanting to know how sex workers navigate their person relationships given their profession. 

I watched a film last night and tweeted at Seth Gamble that he did a phenomenal job at displaying psychological thriller and he ended up liking my tweet, Ahhhhh!!!!!. I‚Äôm so happy, it‚Äôs made my day.

And so, earlier this year I finally made a leap and was pre-approved for a mortgage.  It was scary and nerve wracking.  But a few months later I looked at a house, fell in love with it, and now its MINE!  

And I'm so happy in it.  I have plans for it it, I love having people over to it.  It's fairly close to the downtown area here, so I can walk anywhere I want.  I attended my town's tree lighting last week for the first time ever.

I've spent a long time sort of directionless, feeling like I was stuck and going nowhere.  My parents are both gone, I'm single with no romantic prospects, I work retail.  But this...it's like new life to me.  Like I've finally found and done something for myself, gotten something that's truly mine and to shape it going forward.  I'm excited and happy about my future for the first time in a very long time.

It feels very nice.  I miss my mom, but I'm so thankful that she left me the means to take this step.  I guess a good mom takes care of you literally forever.",RustedAxe88,114,10,1701392869,happy

So I'm just exhausted, I had a really bad day, and I'm just lying there on his chest and he looks down at me.

I just have so much love for this man. He's so dang wonderful, and sometimes I think I might burst. I cried after he looked at me like that and he didn't question it, he just held me and let me cry it out. He just told me how much he loves me and how he's here for me.

186kdwp,Someone from high school reached out to share the impact I had on them,"I was a section leader in marching band my senior year, in 2020. The section became my second family as a freshman and changed my life, I‚Äôm forever grateful for the impact they had on me. Since the 2020 season was impacted by COVID, I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be able to teach the freshmen much actual marching or musical stuff, so I focused on community building. I‚Äôve always found that a strong bond in a group helps people learn and grow; it doesn‚Äôt feel like work, instead you‚Äôre just hanging out with friends. We were at our best when we‚Äôd get dinner after every football game. 

I had four freshmen. One was eager to learn, one was trying her best, one was hopeful but disinterested, and the other was closed off and stubborn. I remember correcting him (the 4th) on a basic posture mistake several times, and after a couple weeks when I did it again, he said, ‚ÄúI know, I just choose not to.‚Äù The audacity of that kid. We took our lunch break and I saw him sitting alone eating. I strongly encouraged him to join the rest of the section. He protested, but I convinced him to at least do it just today. 

He‚Äôs the only one from his class to continue with marching band, he‚Äôs just finished his senior season as a section leader. He‚Äôs grown a lot. He‚Äôs very upbeat, open, and just all around a good guy. We don‚Äôt talk much, as I‚Äôm now in college, but he reached out to me the other day. He sent a long text talking about how that lunch invite changed who he was as a person, and all the impacts it‚Äôs had. He said he tried his best during his time to include the newer people, to make them feel welcome. He‚Äôs done a phenomenal job, I‚Äôm proud of him. My brother‚Äôs in the marching band now, so I‚Äôve seen a few of their performances, and they‚Äôre doing well. 

I left my senior marching season feeling alone and underwhelmed. I knew I didn‚Äôt have the chance to do what I needed to do as a leader, but I was just hoping that what I tried to do had an impact. It did. That one act of kindness set this kid down a brighter path. I‚Äôm so glad to hear it.",HauntedHouse10273,46,7,1701245087,happy

185kb6q,Even now I still smile when I think I played Right Field,"Growing up I thought I was the best right fielder in my little league team. Now almost 40 plus years later I honestly can‚Äôt remember the name of the team or the name of my coach or any of my team mates . However if you would have asked me what position I played I would smile and say right field .  

Let me digress, growing up I can‚Äôt remember doing much with my father. He seemed to honestly working a lot and doing his best to keep food on the table and a roof over our heads. It is what was expected of him as a man at the time and he did it well with little to no complaints. However, for some reason I had the sense that he really wanted me to play little league baseball. I don‚Äôt know why, we never watched baseball on tv and he certainly never took us to any baseball games . Yet, when it came to me playing little league baseball he really encouraged that . And because it was so important to him I did it .  

Now I think it is only fair to point out that I was really bad at baseball. I mean for someone who really prides himself on his hand eye coordination I could never hit that little white laced ball. In fact , in all the years that I played little league baseball I can only remember hitting that ball once ! Hahha ! However despite my lack of hitting the ball my coach always had a way of telling me that I was the best right fielder on the team. He would just look at me and say ‚ÄúI really need you in right field !‚Äù And I would just take off running !  

Even then I never understood what made me such a great right fielder. I mean it seemed that all I did was yell rally cries at my fellow team mates and rub dirt or grass stains into my white uniform because the ball never really seemed to come in my direction. You see most little league kids can‚Äôt hit the ball and those who can normally can‚Äôt hit it past the base line.  

At some point in my little league carrier my dad got really involved with the team and because of such I got moved from right field to other positions. For example, I was the catcher for awhile , first base, and even pitcher for a game or two . Yet , just like my batting skills I was honestly no good at any of those positions. I mean not that it mattered, we where just a team of poor kids born on the wrong side of the tracks playing baseball on a pretty dilapidated base ball field. Even now when I think about it, it was more of a dump than an actual sports facility.  

Thus despite my excellent skills at playing right field at some point in middle school I decided to retire from little league. I just didn‚Äôt like the game and again I was seriously not good at it . I can remember telling my dad one day after a hot afternoon of practice that I wanted to quit. I didn‚Äôt know why but that really upset him. I can remember him telling me that I had to tell my coach and encouraged me to donate my baseball glove and bat because I quote ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt going to use it anymore‚Äù . At that moment I had really disappointed him. In my eleven year old mind I didn‚Äôt understand that me probably playing baseball gave his life meaning and it also probably cost him a chuck of change that our working class household honestly did have much to spare.  

The funny things is that there was lots of sports that I loved to play and I was good at. I was the best tennis player in my gym class and one of the best runners. Yet I guess my dad didn‚Äôt see that and when I quit baseball so did one of the the last parts of my relationship with my father.  

Now, fast forward twenty plus years and I am sitting with some of my college buddies and we are talking about our amateur sports experiences. It was then that I told them I was the best right fielder on my little league baseball team. Then one of my friends starts laughing at me . I was honestly a bit confused and that‚Äôs when he explained to me . In little league almost no one bats left handed and thus the ball never goes to right field . In that moment, my brain began to shift into over drive and then the lights lit up in my eyes, the ever teachers dream to see in a student, and I realized that he was right.  

Not once did I catch the ball, field the ball, or make any play that won the game. However, after years of hearing from my coach, a middle aged divorced man, that I was the best right fielder I honestly believed him. In that moment part of my childhood was crushed and since then I had never felt the same about my little league carrier. I mean I wasn‚Äôt just the worse batter on my team, I was the worse player on my team and that‚Äôs why I played ‚ÄúRight Field‚Äù.

But even now, decades later. I still smile at these thoughts and how my coach made me feel :)",Andtherainfelldown,28,4,1701135965,happy

181wxnh,I Don't Think Anything Makes Me Happier Than Watching Someone Try A New Food,"I'm not sure how common this is but I get insanely happy just sharing a meal with someone or even just watching someone try something new for the first time. There's something really special about that moment. 

I used to watch a lot of Bizarre Foods as well as Anthony Bourdain (RIP) when they were on TV and a quote of Andrew Zimmern's is like framed in the back of my mind. ""Food is the universal language that brings people together."" Like we all have to eat and when you take the time to share a meal together I feel like you can learn a lot about someone.

This thought was brought back to the forefront of my mind just now because of something people would probably find so silly. I was watching a Japanese Vtuber, Yukinoshita Peo, try foods eaten at American Thanksgiving for the first time. It was so simple. Just listening to her talk about it. She's over here trying to learn English and also trying to learn about another culture through its food. I honestly wish more of us had this curiosity. It's also funny because it's stuff I kind of took for granted growing up like mashed potatoes and gravy and yet here she is trying it for the first time and loving it.

I've watched other channels on YouTube that do this regularly and it's just very fun. Even when they don't like it they took the time to try it and it's still enjoyable to watch their reactions of shock.

I consider myself incredibly fortunate to live where I live because of just the sheer amount of different foods that I can find near me. I want to keep trying more new stuff because it's just so fascinating to me, how some are so different and yet also so similar to others. There's commonality that I feel like a lot of us can find in the foods we eat and I find that so cool.

As adventurous as I think I am I still think I have limits simply because some concepts are just too much for me. I think balut will always remain off the table for me lol. 

I think I'll end off my gushing here but man food is so cool lol.

181lqhs,I didn‚Äôt misread the signals: the barbershop meetcute that you didn‚Äôt know you needed in your day,"I developed a crush on my barber, and I assumed that their friendliness must have been part of the job. Because most of the time it is, right? I can and will simply deal with my feelings, as nine times out of ten a crush is a manifestation of your unmet emotional needs projected on to someone else anyways.

It‚Äôs just that after I left one visit I had this unmistakeable feeling where it felt like we clicked talking about all kinds of things. We were sharing facts about cool things we‚Äôve learned about, ranking our favorite space operas, discussing what makes the consistency of a soup worth eating or not. I‚Äôd actually requested a ‚Äúquiet cut‚Äù with this person and I ended up being glad they missed the note because it was genuinely a really lovely, wholesome conversation. There was a period at the end where we made a lot of eye contact, but again, I just assumed this was being friendly. I left feeling so good. Nice haircut, sure, but it‚Äôs not that often I feel like someone is that easy to talk to - I usually request a quiet cut to avoid the smalltalk I‚Äôm not into! 

My friends and I agreed that my crush was innocent enough, it‚Äôs nice to find someone that is easy to talk to, and that I was right - just assume it was generic friendliness from a person doing that as a part of performing the service I was paying for.

A few days after I got back from the cut, I realized that it was still a little bulky in places, and I knew I needed to go back for a touch up cut. I thought maybe I was unconsciously trying to find an excuse to see them again, so I asked a few people their opinions, and sure enough: wasn‚Äôt just me, I should definitely go back for another cut. I had a trip to go on so it would be a week or two, though, before I could get back to the shop.

I got back from my trip and scheduled my cut, and once I got in the chair my barber tells me a story about dealing with a crush they had on someone that wasn‚Äôt reciprocated. We end up talking about how it‚Äôs not the end of the world when someone says no, you can just be friends and friendship is not a consolation prize. They talked about how the other party seemed to think their relationship styles weren‚Äôt compatible, which led to us talking about relationship styles. Then they mentioned they can‚Äôt ever tell when someone is flirting with them, and I said that I‚Äôm the same. They mentioned they‚Äôve been more or less single for a while because they hadn‚Äôt met somebody that they clicked with for a minute. 

The cut ended and I felt like maybe.. maybe that was a hint? I was really unsure. It definitely seemed a lot more personal than any other hair dresser conversation I‚Äôd had before. It was just us in the shop until near the very end of the cut, and so just as I was thinking ‚Äúokay maybe I‚Äôm not reading into things and I should shoot my shot, big risk, but maybe if I am very respectful and offer to go somewhere else in the future if they‚Äôre uncomfortable, it will be alright‚Äù but then I couldn‚Äôt work up the nerve because as I was contemplating it, more people arrived, and I felt nervous with other people there.

So I left and went home and immediately texted a friend. 

Aaannnnnd then I texted four more. 

Because I just needed a larger sample size, than one y‚Äôknow? I really didn‚Äôt want to make someone at work uncomfortable because I misread things!

4/5: yeah in this case you probably should have gone for it!!

5th person: I‚Äôm not sure because I‚Äôm like you, I cannot tell when someone is flirting.

So my ass called the barber shop up. They were with another client and so they called me back later. And I said,

‚ÄúHi <name>, thanks for calling me back. So I am kind of an idiot also and I can‚Äôt tell when someone is flirting with me, and I really don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs what your intention was, but either way, would you like to go on a date? I think you‚Äôre really hot and interesting and I loved hearing about all the things you‚Äôre interested in.‚Äù

I was not prepared AT ALL for the reaction. They squealed, and giggled. It took me a second to realize the laughter was joy because I was just not at all expecting that big of a response. Like, wow - someone felt that way about me asking them out! That‚Äôs so cool! So they said yes, and then they texted me from their personal number later and now I am scrambling anxiously to figure out some date ideas/suggestions.

Both of us are non-binary and dating while transgender is _awful_, unfortunately. I‚Äôm also autistic and am used to doubting my interpretations of social situations, but it turns out that since I‚Äôve dumped a ton of time and energy into learning how to be an excellent communicator, now I just need how to learn to trust myself more because I do get it right more often than not. So I guess, that‚Äôs one more reason to be happy :)",torturecrush,467,25,1700692251,happy

To start let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm a very shy person when it comes to approaching people I don‚Äôt know. More particularly women. I‚Äôm on the shorter side. Average looking. So women almost never approach me. 

There‚Äôs this girl at work I‚Äôve been interested in for close to a year now. She‚Äôs gorgeous. Her sense of style is top notch, she‚Äôs always got some really nice outfits on and always just looks completely flawless. 

She, just like me is very shy. I couldn‚Äôt tell if the looks from her were of interest or more like ‚Äúwhy does this dude keep looking at me‚Äù ü§£ 

Yesterday we had one of the most awkward but cute interactions ever where she had approached me. That was all I needed to say it was time. Women never approach me like that so I was on cloud 9. I went and found her a little later and told her to come holler at me before she leaves for the day. 

After nearly a year of some hellos and nervous looks I finally found the courage to tell her how pretty she is. Ask for her number and tell her I‚Äôm trying to take her out to eat sometime.

180my9u,had the best date i've ever had on sunday,"so i've been talking to this girl, hayley, for the past few weeks now. we matched on a dating app (which i hate but that's the era we live in :p). 

our conversation was super formal and tbh kind of dry in the beginning. she was super nice and the conversation moved smoothly but there wasn't much that gave a ""spark"". we asked the usual like what do you do for work, what are your hobbies, interests, music, etc. 

i found out that she's been playing violin since she was 4 and she is in a band. also, she works as a hairdresser and, i've seen her work, she's insanely talented.

after chatting for a few days, i asked hayley out to coffee and she said yes. 

hayley shows up and she's wearing this really cute turtleneck and she's absolutely gorgeous in general. i love girls with glasses and she pulls hers off so well. 

i spent like 30 minutes picking out my outfit and i eventually went with jeans, a cream colored tee, matching sneakers, and a purple 80s style windbreaker. 

i think we looked good together. 

our first date was a continuation of our text conversations--at least in terms of vibes and energy. i learned a lot more about her family and siblings and we briefly touched on past relationships too. 

her last relationship ended in may; i didn't ask too much to respect her privacy but she mentioned that she is really looking for someone who is emotionally available. i've never really had an issue with that as i'm pretty open and vulnerable about myself so it's nice to know that i check off that box.

there were a lot of pauses in the conversation which i didn't really interpret as being awkward at all; we just did a lot of talking lol. there were there were a couple moments where i made her laugh which was pretty nice. 

we were talking about favorite movies and she mentioned ""i love diary of a wimpy kid: rodrick rules, so my taste isn't all that great"". 

i responded saying ""that's kind of offensive to me, i took a media studies class in college and wrote my final essay on that movie"". 

probably doesn't come off that funny in writing but it made her laugh super hard so mission accomplished. 

hayley also has this really cute habit of having a bunch of catchphrases that is just adorable. something she says a lot is ""don't yuck my yum"" which is just so cute lol. 

the date started to wrap up because she had band practice afterwards but we both agreed that we had a good time and we should see each other soon. i walked her to her car and we hugged goodbye.

cue sunday. 

the original plan was to meet at 5 pm at her place where we would hangout and jam together (i play guitar). 

she had a hairdressing project where she was working on 10 models (which is so freaking cool) but they ended up having to stay until 7. 

since she was so stressed all day the revised plan was to just hangout and chill. 

i show up to her place and her living room has two couches in an L shape and i sit adjacent to her. we talk more about our days, weekends, etc. i had just gotten back from a trip to visit a friend and she's been crazy busy with work. 

i don't know how but the conversation eventually moved from that to just us telling jokes to each other and trying to make each other laugh. this was absolutely amazing. we have such similar senses of humor and her laugh is so cute. 

she mentioned that her brother watches logan paul and then blurred out ""what's up logang!!"" which was so out of pocket and made me laugh so hard. this lead to us trying to out cringe each other which was so entertaining. 

she mentions that she loves jeopardy and i suggest that we watch it. i ask her if she minds if i set next to her, she doesn't, so i get up and sit next to her on the couch. 

she's locked out of her hulu account and fumbles around with it for 10 minutes and getting increasingly frustrated before i say ""tbh, i really don't care about watching jeopardy, I just wanted an excuse to sit next to you"" she smiles. 

we chat and laugh some more. she then starts showing me all of the handshadows she knows how to do and says ""i need something to fidget with all of the time lol"" 

i respond with ""if you need something to hold you could hold this"" and stick out my hand. 

we start holding hands and it's magical. her hands are so small and ugh it just is perfect. 

i forget the context for this but i had asked something and she took a while to think on it saying ""i wanna make sure my answer is correct"" 

i respond saying ""calm down, it's not like i'm interviewing you""

she replies ""in a way, you are though""

i say ""in that case, you're definitely passing; i hope i am too""

she smiles and says ""yeah, you are""

by this point the screensaver on her tv is on and she says ""i've been staring at this for 20 minutes and it hasn't hit the corner once""

i laugh and respond ""we are thinking about wildly different things right now""

she asks ""what are you thinking about?""

i reply ""...smooching ü´£""

she says ""lol, well i am never going to make the first move so...""

i respond ""right, and that's fine, well-but I just want to make sure you're comfortable y'know, anyways, well, um *sigh* --can i kiss you?""

she nods. 

we kiss and it is SOOO good. i haven't kissed that many people and it's almost always awkward at first but it was perfect with her. it wasn't awkward at all and she's such a good kisser. 

after like 2 minutes we stop and i'm just holding her with my head on her shoulder. 

she starts showing me her snapchat memories and pictures of her dog, pictures of her crying lmao, and telling stories of her with her friends and i'm just so happy to get to know her more. 

after she's done i say ""thanks for showing me that it was really interesting""

she says ""well you didn't ask lol, i just started showing you""

i respond ""well regardless, i'm glad you did. it's really nice to get to know you more""

she says ""yeah, i've never showed anyone that, my snapchat memories are for me only""

it's just so comforting to know that she feels safe enough with me to open up a bit more. she seems really reserved and i just want to get to know her more. 

at this point, it's 2:15 in the morning and i have work the next day, i say ""i really should get going but can we kiss goodbye?""

she says yes and we kiss again. after a little bit, i pull back and we stop but i give her a quick peck again and she reciprocates. we just look in each other's eyes for a bit, both smiling. 

i eventually get up to leave and we hug goodbye. 

i fall for people so quickly and i hate that about myself. i've known this girl for a few weeks and it's only been 2 dates. i'm trying to not get my hopes up bc i've been burned before and i don't want to get hurt. 

regardless, every time i think about her, i smile. 

hayley, i know you hate compliments which is SOO frustrating for me bc i love giving them. you are so, so, so, so amazing. it's so cool to me how busy you are and how much passion you have for the things you do. you're so talented and it is amazing to see. i love how much we've laughed already and it's been so fun to get to know you. i know it's still super early on but it's been so fun and i'm having a really good time with you.

#very disappointing update for everyone:

so tonight i just got back from a show that hayley played at. in attendance, she mentioned was a ""friend"" from out of town. she failed to mention that said ""friend"" was her ex boyfriend. after she was done performing she left to go outside with him without saying anything to me. 

i promptly left the venue and long story short, we had a half hour long conversation about how she's not looking for anything serious and is only dating casually and that none of this meant that much to her.

HG is an illness that comes with some womens pregnancy. its basically morning sickness x100 and it lasts all day all night, every day and every night. for me it was worst in the beginning and got better towards the end but i did have it the entire 10mo of pregnancy. i was a sobbing mess that day. i was scared for myself and my baby. i needed a distraction. something to take me away so i could stop thinking about the smell of the hospital and the tubes and wires connected to me. i downloaded Reddit and started reading and browsing and suddenly time was passing a lot faster. today one year later i am sitting here writing this with her on my lap. she is perfect and smart and a true gift. she will be 6mo tomorrow. we made it. one year ago today i was unsure if we would. happy cake day to me.",coldblueskin,40,3,1700537199,happy
180654e,I (33M) love the unconventional relationship I have with my roommate (28f). It brings us both happiness,"I‚Äôve been single for over a decade now and in that time I‚Äôve only had very few brief hookups, no romantic connections, and very few friends. On top of the loneliness, I never finished my degree and my career has stagnated.
 
This is all starting to change now. I have a job where I can pretty much pick my own hours and focus on getting coding certifications and becoming more familiar with finance again. More importantly though is my awesome roommate.
 
My roommate and I have a rather unconventional relationship. I‚Äôve known her for two and a half years. When we first met, I was kind of hitting on her. One time she initiated things and we made it to third base, when she suddenly said ‚Äústop‚Äù. I was kind of confused as everything seemed to be going fine. She told me it was nothing I did, but she just really wasn‚Äôt in to it and was sorry. She didn‚Äôt want to do anything but she imitated things because she liked hanging out with me and thought she would just have to in order to keep guys around and that she‚Äôs aromantic and almost completely asexual. I told her that wasn‚Äôt true with me, and I‚Äôd be more than happy to hang out with her because I like her company, not because I expect her to do anything. 

We remained friends and she was always an upbeat person that would cheer me up whenever I texted her. I always knew she was weird and it was off-putting to some people, but I didn‚Äôt care at all. I‚Äôm autistic so I can sometimes be weird too. About a year ago, there was an incident she was involved in and ended up in a psych ward for a few months. We talked almost daily while she was there, and I learned more about her past. I‚Äôm not going to go in to details, but she‚Äôs been traumatized multiple times throughout her life and is dealing with some severe mental health issues because of that. 

After she got out, we decided to get a place together because she did not want to go back to living with her dad. It‚Äôs been really great. We enjoy each other‚Äôs company, cooking together, watching shows together. We‚Äôve also started a bit of an intimate relationship that some people might find weird but works great for us. This is especially true due to both our mental health issues and the fact that neither of us wants a romantic relationship right now (me because I‚Äôm focusing on work and studying).

Even though she‚Äôs mostly asexual, she still enjoys cuddling. It‚Äôs so nice to come home from a long day and being able to cuddle with her on the couch and watch YouTube or a show we‚Äôre both in to or just talk about our day/life. We also often shower together (it saves water lol), but I really like washing her and having her wash me. She sometimes even wants to have sex, but she‚Äôs told me she never wants me to initiate anything. Getting laid once every month or three is a huge improvement on before. Also, we both don‚Äôt have to worry about wearing pants so it‚Äôs comfortable being able to go anywhere in the apartment with underwear or nothing on which a lot of people can‚Äôt do with a roommate. 

We‚Äôve both clearly communicated our boundaries and what we want from this relationship and really respect each other. I‚Äôm really grateful to have this, and I think for the first time in a long time I no longer meet the DSM5 criteria for major depressive disorder. She‚Äôs really grateful to have a guy that will listen to her, respect her boundaries, and not try to pressure her in to sex like most guys she‚Äôs known have done.",eggs0129,686,41,1700533390,happy

The plumber was already there, working on plumbing at my neighbor's. Still stuck in the snow, my neighbor came to warn me that the plumber was waiting. I was frustrated with my car situation. I went inside, opened the door, and saw this incredibly handsome guy. I was momentarily speechless. After finally managing to free my car from the snow, I went inside. I'm quite introverted and shy in life, but I awkwardly tried to make conversation. We spoke strangely, as if we knew each other. When he finished, we said goodbye, and he left. Later, he returned and rang my doorbell. I thought he had probably forgotten something, but he asked for my phone number!

17wepfp,I‚Äôm so excited to be moving to a whole new city away from my hometown!,"
Despite being super nervous about moving, I‚Äôm more excited about it the more I settle into the idea. 

I‚Äôm most concerned about moving away from my parents and my aunt, but I hardly see any friends of mine as it is. 

Everything‚Äôs falling into place. For a while I‚Äôve wanted to move, but I always resisted it because I had a relationship keeping me back or fear holding onto me. A little over a week ago I was afraid of paying for my bills and now I have enough money saved to uproot my entire life and move to a new city 6 hours away. 

I feel like I‚Äôm being coaxed into moving just because of financial circumstances. I let my company know I‚Äôm open to moving to two locations, and one worker wants to move back to where I am so it works out! He‚Äôs so excited to move back and can‚Äôt wait. Neither can I. 

All of my friends are telling me I need to move and that it will probably be the best thing I will have ever done for myself. I hope they are right! There are more opportunities, more things to do, people to meet, and areas to explore. I‚Äôm an artist and I keep being told that the opportunities there are so much better than where I currently live. 

The more I stay the more reasons I have to move - especially today with a couple of awkward situations that happened. 

Every now and then I get so nervous that it‚Äôs a visceral feeling, but most of the time I‚Äôve been all smiles since I found out the news. üòÅ",GR33N4L1F3,21,1,1700111148,happy

I tend to overshare and a lot of people think I‚Äôm their new best friend or that they are an exception to my rule of wanting to be alone‚Ä¶ but the truth is, I LOVE to be alone most of the time and my social battery drains pretty quickly unless I feel a strong connection with someone. 

Otherwise, I‚Äôm SO EXHAUSTED with the interaction even though I seem excited, engaged and happy to be there. (Good friends can tell when I‚Äôm not.) I‚Äôve had such a hard time most of my life telling people I don‚Äôt want to talk to them. 

I actually told my neighbor today that I am uncomfortable with some topics of conversation and situations, and that I WANT to be alone. I actually told her if I feel like talking or hanging out, I will let her know. 

I‚Äôm SO RELIEVED and happy that I did this! I was becoming so angry and annoyed to constantly have my door be knocked on and be yelled at through the door or the doorbell rung. One time she even pulled me into her apartment by my arm and disrupted my entire night. 

While she‚Äôs an alright person, I didn‚Äôt like certain aspects of this and I finally realized it‚Äôs okay for me to set my boundary and be firm about it. I even told myself if I let her know I‚Äôll reach out when I want to interact, I may actually never want to interact and that‚Äôs okay! 

I‚Äôm just so so happy that I‚Äôm going to be left alone in my home. I don‚Äôt even like waving or smiling at people passing by - unless they are a best friend or family. 

I‚Äôm very much a loner and I just generally don‚Äôt do that or don‚Äôt enjoy that. lol. My best friend told me I‚Äôm too nice and I need to learn to not act so friendly. 

This neighbor told me some troubling stuff last night that aggravated me and she was drunk, which I don‚Äôt like at all.

17qeuf3,I never thought my life could improve so much in just 8 years.,"Never expected this.

Eight years ago I tried to kill myself. It was my third attempt and I hated myself more than anything. There was no break I could give myself that was any relief. My mental, financial, spiritual, and physical health was in shambles. I was a type A and nothing worked out at all.

Today I am employed at a job I love and that actually pays well that is work from home with my two dogs and gecko. I am married to a person that I love so much and is kind and supportive and who understands house work is both our jobs. I recently gave birth to our first child who is the most beautiful amazing boy (I am very biased) ever. My husband and I own our own home and just bought a new car. To top it all off I lost 170 lbs (I had a gastric bypass before baby) that changed my life and gave me energy that I never thought was possible.

All this to say, eight years is such a short amount of time. Life is not perfect (it never is), but the lengths I have come makes my heart happy that I didn‚Äôt die. 

Meds, therapy, and cutting out toxic people got my head right. My financial stuff took much longer but is working. Anyone that is in pain, I know it‚Äôs impossible to see a minute ahead much less eight years, but to quote an old idiom, it gets better. I didn‚Äôt believe it but I have proof now. It will come slowly.",Proud-Pen-1314,69,11,1699421598,happy

17pcjli,"I want to tell you about Essie, and the last few years we spent together","In the year 2015, I moved to the ghetto. My motivation was simple: I wanted to save money, and the cost of rent in this area was significantly lower. I didn't mind the housing conditions, even if some considered them ""subpar."" The savings was worth it.

I wasn't your typical tenant, though. My landlord never knew the truth, but I had to provide proof of income equivalent to three times the monthly rent to move in. My bi-weekly paychecks actually amounted to four times the monthly rent, so I presented a bi-weekly paystub as if it were monthly. I was also a rather ordinary, white, and unremarkable individual.

From the moment I settled into this community, it was evident that I stood out from the typical residents. However, a heartwarming connection was about to take root.

One day, a kind soul named Essie brought over a Pecan pie. Essie was an elderly black woman who had lived in the neighborhood since her husband built their house in the 1950s. Unfortunately, her husband had passed away several years prior. I was profoundly grateful for Essie's gesture of kindness.

A few days later, I had an idea. Essie lived alone, and I happened to excel at making a fantastic steak. I approached Essie and said, ""Hey, I can whip up a mean steak and mashed potatoes. Would you like to come over for dinner?"" Essie was initially hesitant but eventually agreed. It was my way of repaying her for her generosity.

Essie was taken aback by the quality of the steak I prepared. I had gone to my favorite butcher to get it, ensuring it was top-notch quality, not the kind you'd find at Walmart. Essie felt uncomfortable with the meal, repeatedly saying it was too much. I reassured her that I would have eaten steak that night regardless, but it was more enjoyable to share it with someone. She finally relaxed, and we engaged in a delightful conversation.

I've always enjoyed conversing with older people because of the wisdom they offer. Towards the end of our chat, I discovered that Essie was facing severe financial struggles. Later, I learned that her monthly food budget was a meager $200, and that also had to cover her dog's needs. This realization deeply saddened me. Here was this wonderful lady who had raised her children and grandchildren, a truly virtuous woman, yet in her twilight years, she could barely afford to feed herself. Knowing Essie wouldn't accept charity due to her strong sense of pride, I had to approach this differently.

I asked Essie, ""Essie, I bet you're a fantastic cook, aren't you?"" She replied, ""One of the best; I've been cooking since I was a little girl."" With a smile, I confessed, ""I'm a terrible cook."" She chuckled, and I continued, ""That steak was about the extent of my culinary abilities."" It was then that I suggested, ""Essie, do you enjoy cooking?"" She replied, ""Of course, I love to cook. I enjoy feeding people; seeing their smiles warms my heart."" With a warm smile of my own, I said, ""Essie, I want you to cook for me, a lot.""

Essie jumped with joy and exclaimed, ""I'd love that!"" Then, she hesitated, her mind racing. ""But... I can barely feed myself,"" she murmured. I quickly assured her, ""Essie, I'll buy all the groceries you need, and if you'd like, you can even come shopping with me."" Essie objected, stating she didn't want to accept handouts. I clarified, ""It's not a handout; it's payment for you to cook for me."" Essie was open to the idea of cooking for me but strongly disliked the idea of me footing the bill.

I gently persuaded her, saying, ""Essie, your pie reminded me of my Grandma's pie, who passed away a few years ago. My Grandma was an amazing cook, and I'm sure you are too. It would be amazing if you could cook for me, and I'd be thrilled to pay for your groceries in return."" After some contemplation, Essie finally agreed, but she insisted on keeping the items I bought separate.

Essie's first meal for me was Kentucky fried steak, and it was absolutely delicious. She continued to cook for me for a little over two years, but her health began to decline. In the end, I had the privilege of preparing her last few meals. Tragically, Essie passed away in 2018. I remember the day vividly when Essie's son knocked on my door to inform me. He asked if I wanted to say goodbye to her. Essie had passed away peacefully in her sleep, and her son had gone to her house to deliver her medications. The day before, Essie had been scheduled to make chicken pasta for me, but she had not been feeling well, which was not entirely uncommon.

A few days later, Essie's children gathered at my house. They knocked on my door and handed me an invitation to her funeral, stating that Essie would have wanted me to be there. So I attended the funeral. I had never been to their church, and aside from Essie's son, I had limited interactions with her family. However, everyone knew who I was - the kind neighbor who took care of Essie, although it was essential to acknowledge that Essie had also taken care of me.

During the service, Essie's son gave a touching speech, and I couldn't hold back my tears when he said, ""My mom gave birth to a son and two daughters, and later, she adopted a second son who took care of her in her final years. Would the second son please stand up?"" I was hesitant at first, but he insisted, ""White boy, we all know it's you."" With a laugh, I stood up, waving through my tears.

Essie was undeniably an extraordinary woman, and I was profoundly grateful for the privilege of knowing her and being a part of her life. She touched my heart in a way I will always cherish.",AnIdeaMan,1,1,1699303442,happy
17pca7w,Today I made a joke in class and everyone laughed,"I (20M in university) made a joke in class and everyone laughed. But not just a small laugh and that's it.

It was the kind of collective laughter that does not happen very often, so I wanted to share with you people.

&#x200B;

Edit: so people asked me to tell the joke. I was reluctent to say it because it's a joke about Trump but here we go.

So I'meuropean, and my teacher was talking about school in the US. He told the class that in certain school in the US, pupils used computer in class instead of writing on paper, and that it has an impact on their capacity to develop a reasonning - mind that I don't know if this is true or an exageration, but that's not relevant to the story. So the teacher said:

""See ? they stopped writing in american school, and what happens ten years later ?""

After a brief silence, I answer:

""Trump gets elected ?""

There will be a lot to do in terms of getting it edited and ready for actual publishing, but this is a HUGE first step cleared :)",thegeekprofessor,9,4,1698685185,happy

17ji2if,"My Retiring Dad Has Joined Reddit, and He Loves It","It's just the cutest thing, he keeps showing me posts and subreddits he likes. He made a golf post the other day and it's almost to 2,000 upvotes (or 'likes' as he says). He wanted to brag about golf balls, but everyone is just ragging on his beer choices. Y'all are great. 

My dad just turned 60 and is retiring soon, I showed him Reddit because grandpa is a big hermit and I wanted dad to find some communities as he retires. He kept talking about his ""fishing forums"" and his ""camera forums"" and I said Reddit is like having many forums in one place! 

Anyways, just wanted to say my dad is cute, you're all giving him a great welcome, enjoy ""browsing your 'R's"" kiddos",Aalleto,306,19,1698629202,happy

17itlji,I had surgery yesterday and my husband has shown me (yet again) what true love is,"Basically the title but if you want more context: 

It was a minor surgery and it didn't require impatient other than observation a few hours and then home. He cleared his schedule the whole day for my needs which is not all that wild but still. He stayed home on his one day off after a very stressful and SHITTY week to just make sure I didn't wake up and feel lonely after we came home. 

He let me order any food I wanted! We don't usually eat out and I know his favorite thing in the world is not precisely Burger King but it was what I wanted. 

He set alarms on his phone for my medication and came ready with some warm tea and a cold glass of water every time it was time to take it. 

He cleaned the house last night after a week of depression mess so I would have a cozy home to recover in.

He's taken care of all th communication I don't want to deal with regarding the surgery. He kept my mom, dad and sister updated. 

He advocated for me in the hospital when I couldn't find my voice (staff was WONDERFUL I just have severe medical anxiety and I'm terrified of doctors no matter how kind they are). 

He's held me when I've cried each and every time and has assured me that at no point am I being dramatic or too much. He just reminds me I am allowed to feel what I feel and that he's here to take care of me and he's more than happy to do it. 

I had a catheter put in for the surgery and it hurts to pee and it really upsets me. He asked me to wake him up and he would not let me be in pain alone in the bathroom like that. It was 3 am and I couldn't hold it anymore and he came with me and made sure I was okay and then came back to bed where he is right now sleeping next to me. 

So yes, even though this has been awful and a bit traumatic, I am happy because I never thought a man like him could be real and much less fall in love so deeply with me.",downthegrapevine,1231,60,1698547528,happy
17isalo,The stars managed to put a smile on my face once again,"Recently I've been struggling emotionally a lot bc of some pretty major issues in my life which i still have to deal with. Its 3 am and I still havent fallen asleep as Im trying to find more and more closure on my phone. I decided to get up and look out of my window and expected to only see the clouds covering the sky. But to my surprise I saw stars, many stars at first glance as I couldn't decide on which one to look at first. So here I am now, listening to a cover of ""Somewhere only we know"" while still looking at the magical shiny white dots on the dark blue sky. I've decided to share my experience here bc i hope it reaches at least one person who is going to appreciate this experience as much as i do.

my adorable pet budgies who always make me smile with their funny antics and fights, 
and finally... You.
