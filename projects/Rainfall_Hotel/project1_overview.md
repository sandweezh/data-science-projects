Problem Statement:
I am engaged by a hotel in Singapore to analyse how rainfall in singapore impacts the hotel business. As it is very easy now to check the upcoming weather when planning a holiday, during the rainy season, tourists might be less inclined to travel to Singapore, resulting in less business for the hotel. With my findings, the hotel hopes to be able to allocate their resources better in different periods of the year in order to maximise profits.

Steps:
Analysing data of 
1. Hotel Room Revenue
This data was selected as hotel rooms are a hotels main source of income compared to restaurants etc.
2. Standard Average Room Rate
This data was chosen instead of the other room rates where they were differentiated by number of rooms in the hotel as that is a factor which is difficult and time consuming to change. A hotel cannot suddenly increase its number of rooms by 100, so the finding would not produce feasible suggestions.  
3. Standard Average Hotel Occupancy Rate
This data was chosen as people paying when they stay in hotels is a hotels main source of income, and having vacant rooms is cost incurring as not only are you not earning, but maintenance costs still come into play. 
4. Number of Rainy Days 
This data was chosen over monthly rainfall as tourists are more likely to check how many days out of their visit would be raining, as opposed to the total amount of rain in that month, as most do not stay for 1 month, but only a few days. 
5. Month (from January 2008 to August 2022)


From the histogram of the number of rainy days, we can see that the number of days of rainfall we can expect in Singapore each month should roughly be between 10-20 days, which is a significant portion of the month. Hence, this has the potential to greatly affect the hotel's business, and is worth analysing.

Looking at the bar chart of Number of Rainy Days by Year, there is no noticeable trend of increasing or decreasing over the past 14 years, so it is safe to expect similar numbers in the future, and make business decisions based on the expectation of the number of rainy days annually to be between 150 and 180.

When looking at Hotel Revenue by Year, we can observe a strong increasing trend prior to 2018, where there was a large drop in revenue, most likely due to Covid restrictions on international travel. As the world has adjusted to covid, international travel is slowly resuming, and we might expect to see a greater increase in revenue in the future. 

When looking at Number of Rainy Days by Month, we observe that it is quite uniform throughout the year, except the months of November and December. At the year end, this might be a period where travelling is at its peak as well.

However, when we look at the Hotel Revenue by Month, it appears that the revenue generated is quite consistent throughout the year. 

Looking at the Hotel Occupancy by Year, we can see that the levels of occupancy have been around the same numbers over the years as well, except the covid years. Referring back to the earlier chart of Hotel Revenue by Year which had a strong increasing trend, this could suggest that the biggest factor behind revenue is not the occupancy levels.

So instead, we look at the graph of Monthly Revenue and Average Room Rate. The scatter plot shows a large concentration between a room rate of 200-250, with high monthly revenues of 250000-400000. With no other price range even generating revenue close to 300000, it could be an indication that that is the price range which hotels should target, and maybe focus on providing better service or comfort in order to differentiate themselves from competitors, as reducing price is unlikely to yield results. 

In conclusion: the number of rainy days seems to not have a significant impact on the number of tourists staying in Singapore's hotels, which could be due to the fact that the amount of rainy days does not vary greatly in Singapore throughout the year. Time periods also do not seem to play a major role in customers staying in hotels. The biggest factor is in fact room prices, where tourists are most likely to pay for rooms priced between 200-250. This could be a sign of the wealth level of tourists who visit Singapore, which admittedly has a high cost of living, and it could also imply that when looking at hotels, tourists prioritise comfort and quality over cheap pricing. 

Another point worth noting is there are other increasingly popular accomodation options like airbnb, which could significantly affect the hotel industry in the future. It is definitely an area that should be analysed.
