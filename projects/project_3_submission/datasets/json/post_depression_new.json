Its as if you are drifting away from this world and entering your own zone where no one really wants you for you.

Insulted my job, and told me I\u2019m comparable to slave workers back home\u2026just really out of pocket stuff which broke me today. I can\u2019t stop crying in bed and I feel incredibly stuck and hopeless. \n\nAll I\u2019ve been doing is helping my family, providing for them and especially helping my dad so hearing that from him upset me a lot, especially since this job has been so taxing on me. I can\u2019t even function at home after a shift and end up sleeping the rest of the day. and since this job is the highest paying for me right now I haven\u2019t been able to quit in fear of not being able to find another job for a long time due to the horrible job market. \n\nJuggling with the other things mentioned above has sucked the life force out of me and I feel so broken. I don\u2019t know how to keep moving forward in time for exams. Please help me. I wrote this on a whim so I\u2019m sorry if it\u2019s all over the place. I already talk to a therapist but due to her caseload I can only get sessions every 5 weeks under my benefits. ",

I\u2019m 37 now and I\u2019ve been doing research into what can make me better but as Robert Whittaker wrote, there is so much more mental illness now in western societies and we don\u2019t really know how to heal from it except by medicating.

Not to mention all my mental problems that I have and the multiple drug addictions I have. I would literally get high off anything. Oh yeah and I am 16 and have yet to have a girl because I push them away not physically and always wish to have one.

Not really trying to die but just not giving a shit about my body and limits. I don\u2019t want my family to know that I have really bad mental health issues. In conclusion, does my brother have any possible reason to feel any sort of way like this? Oh and also his reason to move out is that he always gets \u201cblamed for everything\u201d even though that our parents never let me hang out with my friends and always find a way to prevent me from having any sort of relief. They never listen to me and think that they can always find a solution for every problem I have. Oh and also my brother thinks he has a good reason to literally cut off every bit of communication with family. At this point we didn\u2019t even cut him out, it\u2019s the other way around.",

Why do i always end up hurting the people i love the most . and why is the urge to kill myself getting stronger and stronger everyday . why am i so reluctant to ask for help , to cry , to talk to someone . yesterday one of my frnd tried to make me talk about whats wrong , i tried , but i was unable to tell her the problem , cuz deep inside i dont knw what the real problem is . they dont know about my past or anything i went through in my childhood . in thier eyes im a happy funny kid who just went silent and went into depression for some reason but in reality i am just a massive failure to everyone who was hiding all the pain behind a fake personality and now the real me is starting to appear . I need help , i want to cry , but i cant ask for it to the people around me , i guess its because im afraid what they will think of me . man i wish i had the nuts to just end it all before coming to canada , cuz i cant do it now , because my parents spent a lot of money on me to be here and i gotta repay that first ........Help me",

(No physical abuse though.) she's constantly complaining about how bad her life is to everyone, even though her own destructiveness is her fault. she's often rude and demanding when asking for something. She'll start arguments over the stupidest things and start yelling at us. And often times when she does this, she always says \"You're just like your father.\" who was abusive, stole stuff from us,  yelled at us, and threatened to harm, and kill us many times. me and none of my siblings are like that.\n\nShe also used to yell at me over very pointless and small things when I was very young. She also somewhat recently let one of her old friends into our house because she wanted a boyfriend. Because the first abusive one wasn't enough. The reason it was careless and shows she doesn't care for our safety is because, she knew he had a drinking and smoking addiction, was beaten as a child, and was very mentally ill. but she still decided to bring him into our home. And big surprise, he yelled at us all over nothing, threatened to kill me in my sleep, and out of nowhere when I was playing videogames with my brother, said to us: \"Do you guys watch pornography?\" When I stopped talking to my mom because of how toxic I was she tried to make me look crazy by saying I'm mentally ill. Which is so manipulative sounding. I just don't know what to do. I need to talk to her because I live with her. And I also need stuff like an ID, a drivers license and other things. I want to get out of the house and stop talking to her as soon as possible, because I can't stand it anymore. I wanted to ask if I should ever talk to her again if she changes, but I don't think she will. She's so ignorant and narcissistic, that I think just waiting for her to change is a mental health deathtrap. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

My dad is dead and sometimes it feels like she\u2019s not there for me now either even though she\u2019s alive.\n\n\u2022 We are moving 4k miles away to Alaska from Texas due to bf in military.

I\u2019d rather stay in this god awful little dusty town in Texas. See, I\u2019m not well. \n\n\u2022 I am 33. I didn\u2019t know if I wanted kids for a long time but I think I might. I don\u2019t feel like marriage / kids is going to happen anytime soon tho. How can I be 33 with no prospect of this? My life is so off track. My bf was previously married and doesn\u2019t want to rush marriage. We will be together a little over two years this month. Sometimes I worry it\u2019ll never happen though. What if I wake up and I\u2019m 40 not much advanced beyond this? \n\n\u2022 I have not motivation to improve my life. Or not much. Laundry is everywhere. House is dirty. It never ends. I don\u2019t see a purpose to myself. I used to do a lot of good things and I was loved and valued by a lot of people. Now I feel like I need to prove my worth. I feel like I need to prove I\u2019m good enough. For my job. My bf. His family. My family some. People around me. Never felt so worthless and ugly in my life. \n\n\nWhen all these things weigh on me, I wonder what is life worth living for? To stress until the end of time and collapse? I just don\u2019t see how most days are worth living. ",

Zoe is doing things to try annoy us, she is giving dirty looks to lucy and zoe's becoming friends with the girl that made me attempt suicide. I am being 100% honest when i say that me and lucy did not do anything wrong to zoe, i've been really stressed about all of this because, obviously, they're my two bestfriends but also because lucy's only other friends are 12 and 13 year olds (i don't judge it but i do think it's a bit weird because we're 15) lucy always wants the younger girls to come when me and her hangout and i really hate it because i think it's embarrasing, zoes hanging out with cool older girls while i'm stuck having to hangout with little kids. I texted zoe telling her i miss her and she screenshotted it with no reply, i dont know what to say or do about any of this, summers coming soon and i already know it's gonna be horrible because i don't have my amazing trio anymore",

For the past few years I've built my personality on lies, trying to tell myself that I'm okay and I got stuck with that personality, an endless cycle of denial. Recently I started to feel better about life, myself, my surroundings etc. But, there's this feeling that has been constantly popping in ny head. Who will I be when I get better? I mean my whole personality, myself, my life, it's all built on me trying to lie to myself. Now i'm scared that when I'lk get better, I won't know what to do. I'm scared that I won't be fitting anymore. As the personality I've created isn't actually real me. And I'm scared I won't be able to keep up with this. That I won't know who I am. That I'll lose myself or whatever I am atm. \nThanks for reading, I really appreciate that. Maybe posting this here will be better than keeping it all to myself.",

        "body": "For some context, my mother and step dad are pretty abusive. They're both addicts to multiple things. My mother has meds but doesn't take them so she goes insane when she doesn't. Throughout my childhood (i'm 14, 15 in 3 months) i've been physically, mentally, sexually and emotionally abused my mulitple people. My dad left when I was young, my mother and step father you already know about, and my grandfather is incredibly annoyed all the time and creepy.    \n\n\nI moved out of my mums house (See my acc for more info) during feburary, well, she kicked me out then took it back a few hours later but i didn't go back. I don\u2019t know, ig I'm just extremely stressed. Like EXTREMELY. I know I'm just about to ramble so bare with me. My gran doesn\u2019t honestly understand anything and she doesn\u2019t understand that just because she doesn\u2019t feel emotions, other people can. She doesn\u2019t get how stressed I am because of the whole \u2018moving out of my mum\u2019s house\u2019 situation and she thinks it\u2019s nothing. I tried talking to her about how trauma is real but she thinks and says I should just grow up and stop being sensitive. She keeps disregarding everything. I asked her why she keeps brushing over everything that my mum\u2019s done to me and she said \u201cWe\u2019ve all had bad things done to us, we just have to get over it\u201d. I hate it so much. I can\u2019t talk about anything around her. She doesn\u2019t believe in therapy or anything like that. I can\u2019t live with anyone. I can\u2019t like with my mum because she\u2019s absolutely insane and fucking abusive, and my step dad is weird and creepy af. I can\u2019t stay at my grans house because of everything I just said, and my grandfather is too much like my mum, or, I guess, the other way around. But he\u2019s creepy too, and gets annoyed over everything. And he gets drunk all the time, ect. (Same with my step dad). I can\u2019t live with my dad even though he\u2019s the only one who gets anything because of his family and my stepmom. School isn\u2019t much better. All the classes, teachers/teacher changes, street area and the fucking option-timetable choices shit are stressing me out. I\u2019m getting really annoyed at everything and I\u2019m petrified that I might start taking it out on my friends, who honestly, annoy the living shit outta me and they really arent't good friends tbh.  I really just wanna do online school but again, my gran doesn\u2019t believe in that. I can\u2019t stop thinking about everything over and over again. I keep having nightmares and I just keep freezing over every little movement someone makes. I just hate everything and I\u2019m so tired of everything. I don\u2019t wanna live with anyone, I just wanna live by myself and stay away from everyone forever. Apartenly, according to my gran, my mum is either \u201cworse than me\u201d and I need to \u201cBe nice to her\u201d because i\u2019m the bad one, or i\u2019m \u201cJust like my mum\u201d and \u201chave to grow up and stop acting like an insane bitch\u201d. I hate this. My mum is most of the time always worse than me and I\u2019m the bad one for having feelings. I just wanna go on holiday and relax for a while but i can\u2019t because my mum needs a holiday and it wouldn\u2019t be fair if I went on one and she didn\u2019t, but at the same time, I can\u2019t be in the same room with her, nevermind a holiday. And I\u2019m just dreading the easter/summer holidays because everyone\u2019s going on holiday, and no one wants to hang out because they\u2019re busy. Not that I blame them of course. But I just don\u2019t wanna sit in the house myself for ages, or worse, sit in the house with my grandfather (He works four days then is off for four days, and repear).   \nA few months ago, I planned to kill myslelf in december, but I got chicken pox (Yes, at 14, idk how that happened), and I couldn't kms.

        "body": "Almost three years ago, I moved into my grandmother's house. I was in a low place, this was before I was diagnosed with any mental illness. I was no longer self-supportive, and my family agreed to help me. It has been a very heartbreaking journey getting my life together. I claimed bankruptcy, had my car repossessed, and ran into legal trouble. I've had a job for the last two years, occasionally taking time off because I had to be admitted to the hospital four times for mental health issues. The last time, I was given Haldol and it turned out I was allergic. I had major side effects including anxiety, insomnia, depression, akathisia (feeling agitated and restless inside causing uncontrollable movements that offer no relief). My face and shoulder muscles would lock up, and I couldn't move. I pleaded with my \"doctor\" to take me off, but he kept saying this is what I needed, so I continued to take it, causing more intense side effects and reactions. Their solution was injecting me twice a day with more Haldol, Ativan, Benadryl, and Cogentin. I wasn't able to refuse the medication because they threatened me with refusing discharge until I complied with my treatment. I was discharged after 12 days and had to go to the emergency room three times that week from side effects I was still having from the Haldol. They finally put it in my file that I'm allergic. I was told the Haldol would be out of my system within six months. I went to three different psychologists over the last six months for help with the damage that drug did to me. Now, I still have uncontrollable movements and bad anxiety. My grandmother belives the symptoms are psychological, and reminds me constantly dispite three doctors saying otherwise My family isn't very understanding when it comes to mental illness, and it has caused a lot of problems. \n\nThings are changing for me now. My debts are paid off, I have my license back, I completed my probation, and I take my medication properly. I do not use drugs. Aside from my family, living situation, and transportation, I am the happiest I have ever felt in my life. I have an amazing girlfriend who has been there for me and supported me, and I love her son. He's five years old; his father is absent in his life, besides a facetime call once every few months. He's such a good kid, and I know what that feels like. I want to be there in his life and I want to begin our future together, but I cannot move in with them or afford a new apartment for the three of us. \n\nIt has gotten to a point where my grandmother and I's relationship is close to being damaged beyond repair. I am not innocent, but I have suffered and worked my ass off to correct my mistakes. It's not healthy to constantly be looked at suspiciously; I'm constantly being treated as a burden (yes, I have been told I was to my face). It makes me feel horrible to bother anyone; it made me very antisocial, and now there's an issue with me just keeping to myself. I'm accused of things I didn't do constantly. I am treated like a child; my location is tracked, and there are notifications when I leave my house. I am not allowed pretty much anywhere without my family besides my girlfriend's or work. I'm being threatened with being sent to another facility even though I've passed drug tests and am taking my medication. I have no money saved because I have been giving 90% of my pay to my grandmother. I do not own a car, and my credit is very poor still. \n\nI have until Monday, the 25th, to find a new home or be sent to another institution. I'm not sure what to do; any advice would be great.",

The pickings are so slim that at this point I am entertaining men I\u2019m not attracted to, because at least this singular guy is smitten with me, is nice to me, does not make me feel horrible. \n\nEverytime I do get a huge crush on a guy, turns out he\u2019s married (great). \n\nI feel like I will never find anyone.

        "title": "Is there a psychological explanation for this experience?",
        "body": "Basically, since a young teen I believed I was worthless and should be punished for my existence. That I was the lowest of the low and everyone was above. I wasn't allowed to feel anger towards anyone or anything. Everything that went wrong in my life I would blame on myself even when logically I knew it couldn't have been my fault, I would find a way to blame myself. If my friend hurt my feelings, I would tell myself it was my fault because I deserved it, or that I was too sensitive or dramatic, and that I should be grateful to be their friend...  \nAnd this anger would build until it was extreme and I would take it out on myself, punish myself. I wouldn't let myself hang out with people because I believed I would make their lives worse by being there. I didn't think I deserved to feel good because I was a terrible person and there was nothing good about me and I didn't deserve life but had to stay just because it would inconvenience people if I wasn't here, and death would mean I didn't have to suffer and I deserved to suffer. I was so upset all the time but when I cried I would punish myself for crying because I didn't deserve to cry since I should be grateful as I wasn't even going through anything and everything I was sad about was my own fault.  \nI struggled with restricting and other physical behaviours which I 'had' to do when I felt sad to 'prove' I was struggling. Then I would end up binge eating which I would punish myself for. I didn't think I deserved support because 1. I was a bad person and 2. I was making everything up.  \nI thought about ways I would physically be able to get help so that I had a reason to deserve kindness. Anytime someone was kind to me I had to punish myself because it meant I had manipulated them into thinking I deserved to be treated nicely. Sometimes I felt so much emotional pain it felt physical and I would internally beg for the suffering to end but then the other part of me would tell me I was being dramatic and nothing was wrong. I would walk in dangerous areas at night because I believed I deserved something bad to happen to me. I felt no punishment would justify what a terrible person I was.  \nI limited myself from opportunities, I stopped doing things I enjoyed not because I didn't enjoy them but because I thought I didn't deserve to enjoy them and was ruining things for others by being there. I didn't put any work into my future because I didn't think I was capable of anything at all. I would even restrict sleep and water to punish myself for continuing to live a 'normal' life. Anytime I was complimented I felt such rage towards myself because I was so angry that those compliments couldn't be true. I wanted so badly to be anybody else, someone worthy of love.  \nI wanted to do the things I loved so badly but I wouldn't let myself. I knew what I needed to do to be happy but I wasn't allowed. I told myself nobody cared about me, and then I'd feel sad that nobody did and then I'd get angry that I was sad over something that I deserved. I had rules like I always had to put others first and if I didn't then I had to be punished. It was like I was in an abusive relationship with myself.  \nI was diagnosed with depression a few years later but I don't think it fits. From what I've read on depression the thought process is more like 'I feel so sad, nothing makes me happy. I wish it would stop. I don't want to be here, I need help.' not 'I feel so sad, no I don't I'm lying for attention. I should feel worse, I deserve to feel worse. I don't deserve help'. I've spent years trying to work out if there's an explanation or why I felt this way but I can't? Does anyone have a name for this experience or an explanation for why it could occur?",

The person he was seeing's daughter found our house phone number and called us to tell us where he was because she didn't like him. At 18, I watched someone I liked a great deal walk away on graduation night and realized I had gone the whole school year without even making an attempt. Just shy of 21, I was ghosted by someone I thought was a friend and who I saw as the older brother I didn't have growing up. The next couple of years I just don't remember at all. Then I got my dog, an all white husky and I loved that dog. Unfortunately she died 3 and a half years ago and the age of 8. They found a mass on her liver and she didn't make it through surgery. The same year she died I found a job that was tolerable. It was a small local restaurant, and I liked the people I worked for and with. I was there for 2 years. Unfortunately, due to health reasons, the owner had to close it down. I thought they were going to re-open, they even had me help remodel the restaurant a bit. I had to find out from someone I worked with that they changed plans and weren't re-opening and had rented the space out to other people. I have no interest in marriage or kids, and no long term plans for work. I have realized that I will never get to visit any of the places I would like to. Even if somehow I manage to make it to retirement it doesn't matter. My mom will be gone, I don't imagine my best friend will still be close (I don't want to hold him back in any way), the things I want to do and the places I want to go won't exist, and I'm not close with any of my sisters.

Was unfriended back in December by someone who I was talking to for a couple years, but they slowly pushed themselves apart from me.\n\nOverall, my hope is decreasing that I'll ever find someone. My depression and self-drive has hit a low I haven't felt in a few years. I feel undesirable and ugly. There's always gonna be someone taller, better looking, and/or richer. I don't know how my friends did it, and I certainly don't know I could ever do it.",

It started (the overthinking) when i was 12 at the time because i have a  grower.But at this age i had this gf that was 15 lets call her Hellen.Hellen was a badie with a perfect body,big boobs,big ass, almost everyone in our school was staring at her body.We started pretty good, but when we got more comfortable we started talkin about sex and we started sexting for a period, then i lost my virginity..Hellen told me i was small but she didnt care but i was fck very insecure about it, bec i knew she liked big penises. I cant stop thining about this, it hurts me so bad that i feel like killing myself, i just want to be loved.I fucking hate being handsome, because everytime i go out and have eye contact with women i always think if they would cheat on me because of my size or when a woman finds me good looking what they would think about my size.I have never told this insecurity to someone, this was hard to write it here and i hope i won't be judged, i just need friends that relate with me.

        "body": "I\u2019m immensely unhappy in my current situation.  I live in a dead-end town with no opportunities, no green spaces, barely any shops left - half the people you see on the streets are drug addicts / homeless and all that\u2019s left here to do is go to the pub basically. All my friends have either left the place or are just functioning alcoholics and very depressed themselves; I\u2019ve lived around alcoholics before and moved across the country alone at 17 to get away from that environment so it\u2019s really hard for me to notice those patterns popping up in people here more and more. \n\nI feel like I need a change of scenery and a change of faces, but there\u2019s nobody left in this town and after a change of scenery I know I\u2019d end up back in the same rut here which completely demotivates me. \n\nMy closest friend moved away for university two towns over to a place with much more investment and much more to do, as a result I have spent a lot of time there recently and made a lot of semi-close friendships there through this closest friend, but that friend has now got a partner meaning I no longer have a place to stay when I go up there and if I go out I have to leave while everyone else is still enjoying themselves. (Them getting a partner has left me a bit worse for wear; I value platonic relationships a lot more than romantic ones and I\u2019ve gone through the cycle of forming a close relationship with someone who then gets a partner and has less time for me leaving me feeling abandoned many times)  It makes me feel invisible, like my presence isn\u2019t necessary and that they\u2019d all be just as happy without me there, and also because I don\u2019t live there I\u2019m not able to develop that same level of closeness with these friends as they do with each other, which makes me feel like putting effort into the friendships is pointless. It\u2019s also really hard to find people who want to spend time doing things that aren\u2019t alcohol-based activities, and as a person who dislikes drinking culture and going out this puts another barrier on me being able to nourish these friendships. I think alcohol is a trigger for my depressive mood swings and suicidal ideations (shocking since alcohol is a depressant) but when in this situations there\u2019s a societal feeling of peer pressure that leads me to drink and then break down and beat myself up for it. There was a time around 6-9 months ago when I would be so overjoyed with going out everyday to see people, because I enjoyed the people and I enjoyed the environment, and now I\u2019m just withdrawn mentally - I can\u2019t see a point in going out to see people whom I\u2019m not exactly fully close with / can\u2019t fully be myself around and to be in drinking environments I don\u2019t really want to be in at all; since things are lined up for me to leave this town in September I don\u2019t see any worth in entertaining this friendships that I know are just gonna fall apart when I move. \n\nSpeaking of the move, it\u2019s obviously good on one hand to get away from here but I\u2019ll be moving to a new place again, starting over again, in a completely different part of the country once again, and this is filling me with uneasy and uncertainty which makes me want to draw back, because even though this place is absolute hell it\u2019s a hell I know and I\u2019m used to, and so many things could go right when I move but so many things could also go wrong - I may not be able to find new friendships and new people I can be myself around again, and I feel like I should just kill myself to spare future me the anguish, even though I know I have people around me who love and care about me and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m overthinking this whole thing. I\u2019ve never really had a support system around me locally before and I feel like it\u2019s all crumbling and I\u2019m terrified for that and I\u2019ve ended up pulling away from them)\n\nM21, diagnosed with BPD & autism w suspected ADHD\n\nSorry for this being kind of a vent post, I\u2019ve been stuck in ruts before but this one feels really different and I\u2019m really lost on what to do so any advice would be really helpful :)",

        "body": "I\u2019ve always been a very goal oriented, disciplined and ambitious person. Depression was something I\u2019ve felt happens to people who experience severe hardship not those who succeed in what many would consider the pursuit of happiness. \n\nAfter university I didn\u2019t get the job I wanted. But took that as extra motivation and after 3 years did achieve what I always saw myself doing: a suit and tie job at a prestigious firm. As a junior starting out it meant long hours, proving yourself and beating others in an up or out culture. As a senior the work load only grew and the weeks, months and years were stressful but rewarding. I\u2019ve learned a lot and grew to genuinely like my job and get quite good at it. The success came as being recognized as one of the global top achievers for multiple years in a row. Which came with a promotion, salary increases and bonuses. Allowing me to pay off my student debt, buy a nice house in a good neighborhood and afford a luxury car. Besides work I got married to my best friend. My wife is amazing. Equally ambitious, intelligent and strikingly beautiful. We have two dogs and our home life is great. \n\nIn short: I\u2019m exactly where I pictured myself to be in my 40\u2019s but in reality most days I feel empty and don\u2019t see the why or the purpose of living. My thoughts are extremely negative all the time. Nothing is ever good enough. My mood swings are constant and all over the place. At work I\u2019ve mostly perfected a professional \u2018mask\u2019. Which I want to let go at home but then feel like my bad vibes are effecting my wife and I don\u2019t want her to start feeling bad as well. So I don\u2019t really have anywhere to go with this as most of my friends and family feel that I should be grateful with all I\u2019ve got and achieved in life. Adding to the shame and guilt I feel by not feeling any joy about it at all. \n\nI\u2019ve tried multiple psychologists in the past as well as mental health aid from the hospital and been diagnosed as depressed. The professionals were never able to help me because of being in their joint opinion a highly functional person without a direct external cause for the depression such as work or family life. Which left me feeling even more misunderstood and alone. As asking for help to begin with was a major hurdle for me to overcome in the first place. The final solution were anti depression pills after I began developing suicidal tendencies. They were horrible and make you feel like an empty shell. Dulling all negative emotions, but also anything positive. I\u2019m still here though so I guess I should give the pills some credit. \n\nCurrently off medications and much better in control of recognizing flare-ups in my depression. But unsure how much longer I can keep this up. With the negative thoughts and no sense of direction I feel like I\u2019m losing the battle against my own mind. Also, I feel terrible for being this way and for my wife to be around me. I want to be the better husband she deserves but am at a loss as to how. \n\nJust wanted to vent this here. Thank you for reading. ",

        "body": "A close relative has had major depression for several years now. It's been pretty severe, including suicidal periods. He currently is on ssris. (Unfortunately only started those when things got really bad. Went many years entirety untreated. They don't really work well. He's not as suicidal as he have been, but that's basically all. ) All that time he had big time sleeping issues. Either sleeping for 20h or being awake for sometimes 2-3 nights in a row unable to fall asleep. Periodically with intense hyper real nightmares. In those nightmares he would recurringly see three creatures. He'd be in a dark, hellish basement like place, together with them. They speak a language he can't understand but he sorta telepathically knows they are talking about evil, death and hell. And even tho they do not physically threaten him he feels extreme anxiety and helplessness facing them. Perfectly aware this is a dream, he is yet unable to wake up even when he panics and feels his heartbeat going through the roof. \nNot too long ago the nightmares mostly stopped. But then he started having more panic attacks in real life. He says, he feels it coming and then all senses feel enhanced, hearing and seeing especially. Everything is super loud and sharp. And then the panic attack comes. Often he starts shaking and can't speak or move. Often this aphatic shaking state remains for an hour or even several hours. Often he has no memory whatsoever of those. For example he went on a trip with his wife, got one of those attacs entering the plane and doesn't not remember flying, riding the bus, checking in, about 5 hours, just erased from memory. \n\nRecently he started having hallucinations being awake. He sees the beings from his nightmares clearly together with him in the room. Being wide awake. It's not shadows. He can see them very clear. He isn't affraid of them anymore. They do not try to kill or severely harm him. But they do tease him, touch him, annoy him and laugh about it. They do not speak to him. He can hear them speak to each other though in a language he can't understand. He says, it's impossible to ignore them, and even though they don't threaten him, the teasing is very annoying and whenever he encounters them, on top of all, it feels like they suck the energy out of him. As soon as the visions are over he is so weak, ha can't move or speak and falls asleep on the spot.\n\nWhenever I read about psychotic depression people say it's auditory hallucinations or shadows and that the voices or figures talk to them about suicide or worthlessness. But his hallucinations do not seem to fit that theme. Also whenever he has those visions he is aware of them being hallucinations (it feels real but he knows they are not. Probably because they are creatures that do not resemble people or animals in the real world). \nHas anyone had similar experiences? \nWhat helped? Certain pills? Certain type of therapy? I'm trying to help but no one really understands what's going on and we don't know where to start. \n",

        "body": "People hold a lot of secrets and they are so great at it to the point where you'd think that it was just human nature. Me on the other hand I hold my secrets because I have no one I can tell. Loneliness it's like a plague that infest the most broken people. You know they tell you that when you get older your friends start to decrease but it's never for certain. When it comes to me it was inevitable because unfortunately I was one of those broken people. Sometimes I ask myself is it better to be lonely and surrounded by people who will never really know you or is it better to be lonely and have no one. I feel like I spend my days wasting time and waiting and waiting and waiting but I'm not sure what I'm waiting for.  \nAm I waiting to be happy? Am I waiting for something to change? Am I waiting for my depression and anxiety to become a thing of the past? Am I waiting for me to change? Or am I waiting for my death? I've never been afraid of it, death that is. In fact I've only been fascinated by it. Sometimes I wish I was a kid who got more hugs and who heard their say they love them. But this is real life and it's not a fairy tale so there's no Prince charming coming to save me and I have to save myself. The only question is how. So I ask myself how to end up like this and how did I end up here. I need to leave here in order for me to thrive in order for me to live. Here is torture, here is pain, here is a constant reminder of I am the why I am. But here is supposed to be home, here was supposed to be the place where I feel safe in the world. But it's not because like I said this is real life and this is no fairy tale for me. Sometimes I wish it was though because then would be easier to be the girl locked in a tower and the handsome knight who's probably white comes and saves her but I would have to be white as well and I would have to have the blonde hair, not nappy nigga hair and blue eyes not the brown ones. My story was already tainted from the beginning not to say that my life made any easier. I'm so tired of saving myself and I'm so tired of fighting for me and I'm so tired of forgiving people after they hurt me and I'm so tired of being me. It's so easy for people to judge each other because they don't walk in the same shoes and they don't see the same views but I wish that I was not different from you. When I think of my future I don't see a happy ending, I see years of healing and years of finding myself and years of learning to love myself. I'm currently in the process of college, working, looking for an apartment, losing weight, fixing my eating disorder, taking medicines for my depression, anxiety and whatever else, paying my debt, working on learning to speak up, fixing my physical health, fixing my life patterns, finding myself and etc. And somehow in the process of all of that I'm supposed to love myself. If I said I give up then I look like the bad guy or the girl who died because she couldn't take it or the girl who left her whole family and loved ones behind or just another statistic. There aren't enough words to explain, to comprehend and to say, that would express how exhausted and drained and depressed I truly am. So yea there's no good ending to this story I'm just a human being, who's broken and lost nothing new.",

Doesn't seem like it does because I've been in survival mode and stuck with depression for over a decade. I'm just so tired.",

Problem is that we life together as roomates In a dormitory so we need to face each other every time, I still got used to this fact but real matter starts here. I have be noticing that they have been manipulating everyone around us , and suddenly all our other friends are behaving as strangers to me, including our other roommates.  I feel so lonely and alone that I can't even tell this to anyone. That person has used me all the way in our friendship that I realized after we ended(actually they ended, cause they said that they don't want to be friends anymore, being roomates is better than being a friend ) I realized I have me used , manipulated and misguided all this time, people around us have taken sides, they have chosen whom to be with so fast, I feel like I was stupid as I thought that person is the one and I pushed everything and everyone away that now when they are gone I am alone . I am being the bad person in everyone's perspective even though I didn't hurt that person or said anything bad about them. No one wants to listen to my explanation or reason , I may not be good in words like them but I know I have been a good friend all this time.\nI want to go somewhere away from all of this, In our room I feel suffocated , but I have no other place to go. \nI can't focus on my work or anything but I see them enjoying,  working etc as if nothing happened that hurts me the most.\nI want to move on in my life but I can't. \nIt's like I am given some kind of punishment for trusting wrong people.",

However, after  years of  experimenting and patience, I had finally landed on the one med that had kept my depression under control for past 2 years. But, 2 weeks ago, I had to be put on a medication necessary for another physical illness, and have now  spiraled into a brutal suicidal depression. Depression is a well documented possible side effect of this med. I can\u2019t go off because I would die, but if I don\u2019t, I feel like I will suicide. How in the hell would depression be treated if it\u2019s a side effect of a medication? My psychiatrist isn\u2019t helpful. \nThe med is like throwing gasoline onto a fire!\nAnyone gone through same thing? Or have thoughts? I can\u2019t picture being on this med for the rest of my life.

        "body": "I never was a particularly happy person but last year has been rough on my mental health and something I'm experiencing now (that I haven't experienced during other low points in my life) is that I don't truly feel like myself anymore. May be because while I turned 23, I haven't accomplished any of the goals I thought I would accomplish at that age. I feel like I was the happiest at 21 y/o (22 sucked, 23 will either suck or be the start of recovery. Or both)\n\nI used to be passionate about books and movies (now mostly apathetic), excited to learn sewing and knitting (now I get annoyed and frustrated), loved long walks in nature (now I only go to get some fresh air and physical activity, it's like a chore). Even music doesn't bring me joy anymore, I just use it (on headphones) to tune out noises like the neighbors talking too loudly or the sounds of roadwork outside.\n\nIt's not only mental stuff. I lost weight because of my bad eating habits and while I've never considered myself beautiful now I actually kind of hate how my face looks and how some of my clothing looks visibly too baggy. That's not the face I've grown used to seeing in the mirror over the years. I actually started eating regularly and cooking nutritional meals because of that so I guess that's one positive thing.\n\nIt feels like there's a warped version of me inhabiting my body, that's the best description of it. I have already made an appointment with a professional but I want to ask: after starting treatment (antidepressants, therapy or both) has any of you started feeling like yourself again? How long did it take?",

I got drunk everytime I had the chance. It was a huge relief. The numbness is like heaven.  \n  \nAnyways, we had a stoner in our group.

Everyday since then has been constant fighting and the only way I've delt with it is by dissociating.

I have no friends because he accuses me of cheating and flirting with everyone. \n\nI'm leaving him in 55 days and the closer it gets the more real everything feels. I don't want to eat, I don't want to work, I don't want to sleep. I'm anxious all the time because I know he knows he's losing control of me. All the things I've managed to do while being abused (working regularly, getting good grades, taking care of myself) are suddenly so hard for me. \n\nI'm so close to getting my freedom back and I've never felt more trapped. \n\nI feel so stupid.

I get to live in one of the most exciting and culturally vibrant cities in the world. I get to have everything I've wished for and I can't feel happy about anything. ",

        "body": "34/F Does anyone else struggle morning sadness? I\u2019ve been going through depression and anxiety lately. The mornings are rough. I feel lifeless and just sad. As the day goes on I start feeling somewhat better but man the mornings set the mood so waking up and immediately feeling sad is so frustrating. \n\n  It all started when I found out my only child who is now 14 had a gf. It opened my eyes up that I no longer have a \u201cbaby\u201d he\u2019s growing up becoming his own self. Life. I know. So it hit me pretty hard and put me in a bad mental state. I started getting crying spells, anxiety attacks and just being sad alll the time. I\u2019ve lost interest in life. Don\u2019t feel like eating, don\u2019t want to watch anything. I\u2019m loosing sleep. I try to go on walks and runs but it doesn\u2019t seem to help. I\u2019m just so tired of feeling this way. \n\nI got my labs checked everything came back normal. I\u2019m talking to a therapist but it\u2019s only been one session. I have also been on birth control for over 10 years and I\u2019m getting my mirena iud removed on Wednesday hoping it will help? I\u2019m just also scared with the after effects of how my body will change being on hormones for so long. I\u2019ve tried researching it and some say it could be the cortisol? Idk I\u2019m just so tired of thinking about it all the time! I just want to be happy. \ud83d\ude14",

Today there was an argument and I tried to make them talk it out, pointing out both of their mistakes and then my mother started crying, screaming, threw a pillow at me saying \"you left me too\" while my dad was trying to calm her down and she left a note at my table saying \"U also left me alone\" I hate my life. They put me on a pedestal and then do this. They do this everytime. Every fucking time they just have to fight and fight and fight about everything and then somehow i'm the one who left their sides. I want to kill myself. As much as I love my parents, I hate myself for being the worst son to ever exist.",

        "body": "Hi r/depression - I (23M) have known this girl for some years (22F), and our relationship started off on the internet. When we talked online before we met, she always seemed happy, interested and seemingly had a crush on me, as did I with her. First time we met she seemed just as she always had, but this quickly changed a few days after our first date, and she started ignoring my messages. \n\nWhen I asked her about it, she told me she didn\u2019t mean to hurt me, but that she was isolating a lot and wasn\u2019t ready to be in a relationship, because she was suffering from depression and didn\u2019t feel anything for me or anything else in general - I told her that I understood, and despite being in love with her just wanted her in my life and as such was fine with just being friends at the moment, and to support her however I can, which she agreed to. Since then she mostly still keeps ignoring me however, and whenever she texts me it\u2019s always very short and dry. I don\u2019t really care much about texting in general, but it really makes me anxious when she ignores me for more than a week sometimes and won\u2019t answer on if she wants to do something together, because I know she meets up with friends and texts them etc., and it makes me overthink a lot, in specific that she is just trying to ghost me, since I seem to be the only one who gets this treatment AFAIK\n\nI don\u2019t recall me doing this when I was depressed myself, so I\u2019m curious as to if this is something any of you can relate to and if so what causes this for you, or if she really is just trying to ghost me, although I\u2019m not in doubt at all that she is depressed. I\u2019m sorry that this post comes off as very egoistical, I really do want to support her however I can, but I am worried about asking her about why she is ignoring me and seeming clingy, and fear what consequences it would have on our relationship - as well as my depression coming back if I don\u2019t try to handle the issue soon, as it really is making me feel ignored and has been messing with my selfworth a lot recently\n\nIn advance thanks a lot for any help! :-)\n",

There is only so much I can do. \n\nI yearn for a better day. I yearn to wake up and not dread the day. I yearn to just live a life, my life. But until then, I wish I just didn't exist. ",

        "body": "    I feel like some of the best times of my life were when the most traumatic incidents were happening to me, and afterwards, all I ever remember is thinking that I wanted them to happen, over and over and over again. I never thought of them as being traumatic in the moment, but they ruined my perception of reality and what normal things feel like and I haven\u2019t been able to enjoy normalcy. \n\n   A lot of my first sexual experiences were online with older men when I was a minor, I guess I just didn\u2019t realize how heightened the experience was because I was younger, and because it was so taboo. That started being the only thing that I favor, and now that I\u2019ve been in adult for some time I realize that those experiences are not normal and they\u2019re very heightened in a way that you\u2019re doing something wrong and I\u2019ve noticed that that alone can be a huge sexual attraction just because it\u2019s wrong just because it\u2019s shameful and because you shouldn\u2019t and I didn\u2019t realize that that was a huge factor. Now that everything is not off-limits anymore and I can do whatever I want as far as consensual sexual relations, I don\u2019t feel that attraction anymore. Also getting use to people and experiences. \n\n   None of it as special or as romantic as I ever thought it\u2019d be. It\u2019s been no more a huge letdown after fantasizing about it, my entire childhood, because it calmed me down and it was one of my only skills as much as that\u2019s not a good thing it\u2019s all I found that worked. \n     Anyway after a few my relationships that went very south and hurt very bad, I was not myself. When I got into my current relationship a year and a half ago I kept expecting to feel a lot more than I ever actually have and I always questioned if it was just me comparing my very heightened experiences to a very normal experience or he\u2019s become too normal to me or if I don\u2019t feel anymore at all. \n      I got very depressed after the last relationship that I was in. Starting this one, I wasn\u2019t on good terms with myself, and I also hadn\u2019t had nearly enough time I needed to heal from my past ex. I had so much joy for that relationship and to learn that it was a lie and of course I was being groomed I just, don\u2019t understand why reality is bitter because it makes me feel more dead inside then when I was being straight up lied to.\n\n      I believed everything and it was blissful and now I live quite the same reality that I was wanting so I got what I wanted, but the emotional connection is not there and as far as relationship problems go, I\u2019ve hit the lottery with them and not because of who I\u2019m with but because of my needs because my partner doesn\u2019t particularly shine in those areas so it takes extra work on top of the long hours he\u2019s already gone. It makes me feel bad for asking so I\u2019ve gotten to the point where I\u2019ve stopped fighting for what I want in the relationship. \n       It doesn\u2019t help that I found out that I was pregnant pretty recently and of course he was way happier about it than I was. But totally looks over the neglect I feel and the depression aspect like the kid is gonna help it go away to an extent. \n     I feel like I\u2019m dying as a person my identity is gone. I\u2019m not sure who I am anymore because my favorite versions of myself are all in the past and I don\u2019t feel like I can be myself the way that I should anymore. I look at myself in the mirror and I\u2019m not proud anymore, I\u2019ve lost interest in nearly everything I\u2019ve ever enjoyed, except for superficial things that remind me of memories that I wish I was having, with lots of love. The only thing that makes me happy is just fantasizing about things that will guarantee physical, emotional and spiritual connection. \n     My partner is the only person that I interact with during most days except for calling my mom or my dad. On days that we are fighting, I have to wait until the next day or the next day after that to get any kind of emotional connection again. I also have no girlfriends and no plans to go back to school. I just kind of sit in the house all day and rot. \n     Some days all I want is to be young again to experience all the best days of my life when my hope was at the highest and my dreams felt more possible and way less scary. \n  ",

It is frustrating for both of us and on top of all the rest taking a toll.\nDo you know of an article that explains in layman\u2019s terms what depression is and what the sufferers go through?\nOf course I tried to find a source but got overwhelmed (ADHD + currently in the deep dark \ud83d\ude1e)\nThanks ",

I'll probably delete it soon.   \nI managed to do well in school, got a master's two years ago, and still stuck at my part time job. No friends, no social life, no hobbies or interests.  No career direction - I feel like I did these degrees for nothing sometimes. I feel like I was living someone else's life. I have crippling anxiety, low mood and insecurities and don't have enough to live to move out of my parent's home even if i wanted to. I'm so socially isolated that I've become used to it and I kind of like it now, but it means that going outside is overwhelming. I feel like I did degrees that I ended up not being as passionate about as I thought I would be. I can't plan anything until I have money/a stable job, but I can't find a job. I have so many rejections, failed interviews etc. I am stuck in a cycle that I can't get out of and I feel so ashamed and like a loser. I can't get out of this mindset although I am trying to commit to exercise and hobbies etc and being positive. It's increasingly becoming difficult and I see no way out. I feel like I am wasting my life and I regret almost every decision I've made in my life. I go to sleep with thoughts around death and with this pit in my stomach. I feel like I am reaching the end of my rope sometimes",

I want to die and I hate having an obligation keeping me here.

Every fucking one of you and it\u2019s not fair on you and it\u2019s not reasonable and I don\u2019t care but I do and I feel horrible for it. I should die. I deserve nothing, I am nothing, this is what happens when nothings try to be something.

I get that I \"lost myself\" in the relationship, but even things about me unrelated to my ex are gone. Life has become a confusing mess where I have no idea what's important anymore. After the breakup I moved to the middle of nowhere and worked for my brother for 7 months in isolation, having no friends beside coworkers who bullied me while I fawned and tried to just endure it. Now I'm working for my other brother who wants to do literally everything together and keep me as his sidekick and micromanage my life. \n\nMy ex was the only good thing to happen to me, the only good relationship I've had in my life and it's gone. The worst part is she moved on pretty fast and her life is so much better than when we were together. I don't get how people can do that. I have no way to make friends or build my life back up. I forgot how to talk to people and I have no personality to show them. And I'm starting from complete zero now. It sucks. And nobody will help me. I'm not a child that people can take under their wing and teach. Nobody gives a shit about some broken 23 year old, you're just fucked. If you didn't have a healthy childhood or fixed your problems before you became an \"adult\" then you're considered a failed human.

Me and my mother do not have the same view in life. Perhaps because of religion and culture, (she is African), she has a different way of thinking. I am not saying that people of certain religious backgrounds and ethnicity are bad, but you know some cultures put different types of view on people.\n\nWhen I was twelve I started hurting myself, and the problem is that my mother said that I was acting white and that if I wanted to die I should and could, it's free. She doesn't believe in depression Only when it's here, and she has a lot of negative views on some people because of her religion, which is contradictory because she is supposed to not judge...\n\nWhen my brother was born, I had to take care of him a lot. I was eight when I had to take care of him at night after school while my mom worked. I know we haven't had the easiest life, I grew up in Congo and it wasn't easy then we went in Europe, Belgium... now we are in France. And  she did worked a lot for us, now I have my own room and a house, I know we were even homeless once, but does that mean I deserve those words?\n\nI started working hard, really hard at school as if giving myself a point in life...I also really love art, which is the only moment I feel happy.. but I feel so hopeless. If it wasn't for my brother, I'd go away, and perhaps I'd let myself die. \n\nI don't want to leave him alone with her. I'm really tired, all my efforts are worth nothing. I rarely eat, I don't sleep.... Sometimes, I wish my brother didn't exist, because I would be able to go in peace if it wasn't for him.\n\nThe worst part is, I feel as if I am not allowed to feel this. I am not allowed to feel sad because people have worse, I am not allowed to feel sad because we have lived worse in the past. I finally have a home and I'm in a pretty free land with good people, I'm not allowed to feel this..\n\nBut I do.\n\nI'm planning on waiting until my brother is older and financially stable enough to go....

        "body": "Hello.\nI (23f) dated a guy (23m) for a bit under a year. We were long distance and even though we broke up, I would say our relationship was a really nice one. He opened himself to me since the beginning about his struggles with mental health. It was quite bad. He had suicidal thoughts since a young age because of many things that happened in his teen years: like being badly bullied, girls asking him out as a joke, his parents way of parenting, etc. He grew up to become a really insecure person. While we were dating and after he confessed that he didn\u2019t feel good enough to deserve \u201csomeone like me\u201d in his life. \nHis parents opinions have always had a big toll on him. From his dad telling him \u201cmen do not cry \u201c \u201cyou\u2019re not depressed, your friends are feeding you wrong ideas\u201d \u201cthere\u2019s not such as thing as depression\u201d and his mom is quite similar but more on the over protective type. During our relationship both would treat me as a gold digger and his mom would tell him any chance she could get that or relationship was deemed to fail, that he should date other people and I wouldn\u2019t find out, that I\u2019m toxic, that he should date a real European girl (I\u2019m from Latin america) etc. Hearing all this opinions + his insecurities led to our breakup. \n\nMonths later we started talking again as friends, and I came to the realization that his view of relationships has become really worrisome. I always knew he didnt have the right view of what a healthy relationship meant. But it has gotten worse, it was never to this extent. He thinks the only way to be loved is to feel loved by another person (a relationship). He has become obsessed with finding another person, and that if he doesn\u2019t get into a relationship before 30, that means he\u2019s a failure. I asked him what would he do if he\u2019s single by 30, and he admitted he would kill himself. I genuinely didn\u2019t expect that answer. He recently got a crush, and if she rejects him, he will spiral badly again, which I\u2019m 100% it will happen. He gets crushes to fill his lack of self love. Thats also why his friend and I agree that he won\u2019t ever have a healthy relationship till he gets help, he\u2019s sadly really easy to manipulate. To feel loved and included he will follow what any person would say to him. Because of this new mentality is also also why he felt the need to \u201cblock me\u201d out of his mind before, cause he started thinking his clock was tickling on getting over our relationship and trying to find another gf before 30 (during a bit after the breakup he became \u201cmean\u201d but later apologized and admitted it was because that\u2019s how he was treated before, and he thought that\u2019s how it was supposed to be)\n\nAt least, for this time. I won\u2019t leave him alone. I can\u2019t and I genuinely won\u2019t. I\u2019m the only person he fully trusts to send me messages when he\u2019s feeling bad. And I have no problem with answering to his good morning messages that give him quite comfort. I do think I would obviously love it if eventuality, getting the help he needs, he won\u2019t need as much as reassurance he needs from me.  And will be able of living the life he deserves. He\u2019s not a bad person, but he doesn\u2019t see it himself. He\u2019s great. He genuinely made me really happy, and I\u2019m sure he also makes all of his friends happy too. \n\nHe does have friends that have noticed his bad mental health, however he doesn\u2019t open up to them fully. I would say I know 85% of the situation, while he tells his friends around 30%. Only one of them I would say knows around 60%. He looks at her like a sister. After we broke up I messaged her to please check on him, and now we talk from time to time, not only about my friend but we also just found each other quite nice to talk to. She knows about his struggles, and has always been open to hear him. In general his friends are really nice, and have always tried to comfort him any chance they can, they said they also noticed \u201csomething was going on\u201d since the moment they met him. \n\nBecause of how bad his mentality has come, him saying he will kill himself if he doesn\u2019t date till 30. (One month and a half ago he also wrote what would have been his \u201csuicide note\u201d. I only found out later when he confessed he felt bad for having people worried for him, cause he wrote it in the note along with writting that he felt bad for being a baggage for me, I could never see him that way). \n\nThe question is. I don\u2019t know if I should, at least, make his closest friend aware of this. She doesn\u2019t tell him when we talk about him, me neither.  When we talk about him is mostly us checking up on him. If I was living close I would maybe keep it to myself and try to make him get the help he needs on my own, but I don\u2019t live close. His friends (his closest friend) do. They do have suggested him to try get some help and even tried to talk to the uni staff about it. I\u2019m not sure if I should tell his closest friend a better idea of how bad things are getting. Since she, again, lives closer and I think could be of greater help for someone that\u2019s actually physically close to know about it. \n\nI\u2019ll probably get comments saying to just let him be, and is not my responsibility, but I won\u2019t leave him during this time. \n\nI recently sent him a care package and it arrived today. So he\u2019ll go to pick it up. From time to time I also send little details. Like a hand warmer, sweets, etc. I don\u2019t want him to forget he\u2019s not alone.\nThe care package contains: find Waldo images that I printed, origami tutorials and color paper I cut myself, sticker by number that I found of his favourite flower (he also fell into game and porn addiction, and says he\u2019s stuck in this cycle, I gave the suggestion to try hobbies, and he won\u2019t do it till someone gives him all he needs, that why I added that), QR code to fonts that I bought since he studies graphic design, chocolates for his friends and salty treats for him since he doesn\u2019t like sweets, a beanie (he lost the one I gifted him a year ago, and felt really really really bad about it, so I checked multiple stores to find the same one, and I did find it !), good luck charms from my country, etc \n\n(Sorry for any grammar or any mistake I general. I\u2019m writing this fast before starting my day at my job) ",

To know her and to be known by her. I want to sleep next to her, cook together, and raise our kids together. I want to love, be committed to, and serve my wife. I want all of this.... along with sharing sex with her. Am I so terrible for wanting that? \n\nI just feel so disgusting for wanting sex. It's not the only thing I want, but I feel shame either way. I know it's just the culture, and that girls are taught to hide it, but I've grown up with the idea that girls don't want sex. That girls don't desire that and they don't get temptations. \n\nWhat I want is romantic and meaningful but I just feel like an animal. \n\nI just feel like I'm never going to be understood and/or never find a wife who will want me.

I also compare myself to others whoever they are form my friends to everyone in every details small to small. I am very reserved . I also think I am a narcissist .I also don't feel any emotions for anybody. I don't have any creativity in me thats why I can't make conversations make jokes laugh with people make memories . I feel to anxious when I public and can't talk to people and I can't make an eyecontact with people. I just am unable to behave normally. I don't have any friends . I am just becoming more toxic day by day. I also have a problem of perfections that why I think I never did anything in my life , never did anything completely. God has given me no good except more bad. I am too logical. I always procrastinate things. I am too adult for my age and in a bad way(I am not mature like others but kind of old ) . I am too concious of myself and when I make some mistake I immediately start seeing around me if somebody notices me and as I have turned 18 I can see many changes happening in me as a result I am no longer innocent like others like whenever something bad happens around me I am become too much aware of it and it feels very bad while others don't even notice it and remain happy like I used to be before in childhood. Also I don't like sports like others. I have too much dark interests unlike everyone else. Sometimes I think all this is due to me being born in 16 December which is the worse date of the year as I have seen people born in December are worse people neither they look good nor they have talents. I know I may sound stupid here but all this one of my dark interests which I have wasted my life observing.   Why God made me like this . I want to be those normal people who I see everytime make jokes happily going outside doing fun things with each other. I am too different from others. Also I have problems with doing daily chores but nobody has this problem. Sometime I think should I make a baby in my future as he will also suffer like me . I want to die .I did nothing good in my life nothing memorable . Whenever I am in a group I am always seen as very different while others belnd themselves in the group. I am always outcasted. Also seeing too much Google making theories about my insecurities made my life, my mind a hell . Nothing exiteds me now . Nothing feels the same . Am I normal .",

I didnt really feel like drinking that, since it was so annoying for him to Help me. \n\nI just thought he would be more understanding.

I have no goals, no social life, no desire to do anything. I'm also Muslim and of pakistani decent. I'm addicted to porn and have been since I was 13 , it gives me the littlest drop of dopamine I have to get through the day. I'm a second year in college right now with only 30 credits, no clue what to major in (I went from Electrical Engineering, to Economics, and then transferred to another school that takes 1.5 hours on public transportation). I live in NYC so no way I can drive to my school. I did architecture for a semester and did complete garbage. Now I'm studying Construction management. My dad wants to do Construction after retirement and decided to purse the same degree as me, as well as my cousin. (Crazy right?) Now whenever I say I'm struggling with a class or it seems too hard, he's like \"i work full time and got an A in those classes, so you can do it too\", or \"youre not putting in the effort.\" The truth is, fuck this life. Why should i try for anything at this point. I also work part time, and my job requires me to be a full time student, otherwise I have to resign. I withdrew from 3 classes last semester so I am on academic probation from my job. This semester I took some bullshit classes to get my 12 credits and keep my job. But there seems to be no end. I'm miserable, and my parents won't let me take a break from school otherwise I have to move out. I literally have to be in school right now. I've been told \"it doesn't matter if it takes you 10 years you're getting this degree.\" I've been asked by my bosses what my hobbies are since they know I'm not doing well in school, and i have no clue how to answer this question. All the money i make goes to paying tuition as I do not get any financial aid. I have no interests or desires to do anything. I'm eventually gonna run out of easy classes to take and stay full time. This is my 3rd time taking calculus and im probably gonna fail again. The only thing I do if I'm not at work or school is in my room and watch porn,  not even because of the attraction anymore, it just gives me some comfort. Or I scroll through Instagram reels.  Ive tried to quit porn many many times, but go back to it after a week at most. Its ramadan and i still fall into this habit after sunset. My dad and uncles and their friends bring up marriage to me and it always pisses me off as I can't and am so depressed to the point where I'm not really attracted to anyone anymore. Why the fuck would I get married right now? I understand it's part of my religion but no way.  If I could get a job where I could make like 55k and never advance and do it the rest of my life, I'd do it. I have so much to say but idk what. \n\nI'm very shy and anxious too. I don't go anywhere and run from interaction. My only highlight of my day is taking the train to and from school, or the bus. I genuinely wish I had direction, or ambition and definitely a girlfriend, but I'm so empty inside. I had a mental breakdown on March 1st in My living room and cried for the first time in like 3 years in front of my parents, uncle and 3 sisters. I cried for about 5 hours that day. I'm a complete mess right now. Life actually sucks right now. I have nothing, nothing. \n\nIf you read all of this, I really appreciate it. I needed ",

        "body": "I'm 17 and female. A few months ago I dropped out of sixth form because my mother was concerned about me. I was getting picked on and wasn't being social enough, i couldn't get any work done due to inability to concerntrate and lack of any motivation. I now stay inside all day and have an addiction to shitty imageboards, fanfiction sites, discord, and reddit. Whenever i scroll i feel like a part of my brain is wasting away yet i can't stop. I keep my curtains shut so i don't have to see what's going on outside as i might start wanting to go out or feel like i'm missing something. I have no friends irl and only interact with people online for discord game jams, fantasy anime leauge and anime discussion on imageboards. I can't even play online games with voice chat because the idea of speaking to people through audio makes me feel horribly sick and lightheaded. I spent my 17th birthday crying alone quietly because i'm one year closer to having to get up and take responsibility for things which i never want to do. I hate interacting with people who aren't my family because they all backstab you and think they know what's best for you and I have no real interest in anything they have to say. I've grown to much prefer characters and concepts because they cant change suddenly, or be snarky. I also hate the responsibility of having to speak to someone daily as it makes me feel burnt out pretty much instantly plus i struggle with giving people advice and generally understanding them. I've ended up pushing away so many people because socialisation makes me extremely exhausted. Theres no point in having friends if i grow to dislike being around them or get burnt out and can't hang out. For the good of the other person i just push them away.\n\nI hope you, the reader, are understanding how big of an issue this is for me. I'll probably be forced to return to school in september but i will certainly end up dropping out again. I don't even have any sort of job i want to do, or special talent. My routine is wake up, go online, eat lunch with my family, go online, eat dinner with my family, go online until 4am then go to bed. I'd really like to die, as i'm just spending my life sitting alone without much career purpose. If i can't find a career in future I'll just kill myself as punishment for being a leech on society.\n\nI can't go to a therapist because my mother refuses to let me do anything like that and \"doesnt want\" me \"to be that kind of person\".\n\nMy main focus for now should be to go outside but it's really terrifiying. I'm worried i'll see people. Plus i live nearby a secondary school and seeing teenagers and kids makes me feel ill, especially when they're in large groups.",

(Please be gentle, it's not my native language.)\n\n\nAlmost a year ago I finally got back to work after being at home for a few months due to my depression. I slowly came back to living my life, having fun and maintaining my hobbies. I was so happy, I thought I had overcome depression. I knew it won't be gone for ever, but as the winter depression didn't catch me this time I was really optimistic.\n\nBut here I am, sitting on my couch. Cuddled into blankets, having a hundred tasks to be done, questioning if my earlier much loved hobby is still my hobby as I don't enjoy it anymore. I don't know when I showered the last time. \nIf I weren't with people yesterday I won't have eaten anything besides the chocolate next to me. But I gained weight, I'm sad. The package I really need to send stands patiently in my kitchen. I already send it but I came back and I'm overwhelmed. I have to be more careful this time. But it's expensive and complicated. I don't want that anymore.\n\nI'm reflecting how I lived my life the last weeks ... And now I see all the little signs which tried to tell me \"Caution! Depression incoming! Be careful.\" But I ran past them. Directly into \u2728the depression \u2728.\n\nThe end.\n(Not my end! Just of my little sad story here.)",

At the point, I was struggling with coming out with my family, financial constraints and rentals. I constantly felt trapped and helpless, and had been suicidal for 3 months on end. Because of past trauma, my girlfriend was one of a few people who could relate to me. I could reach out to her for sympathy, understanding. She was both a listening ear and someone to bounce off ideas for solutions.\n\nBefore I asked her out, I made it a point to start therapy because I did not want my gf to be doing all the emotional labour in this relationship and picking after my slack.\n\nMy therapist did caution me against starting a relationship given how I had been going through countless changes and am need of time to settle down and adapt to my own life. However, I just went ahead with the confession thinking that I did not want to miss out the beautiful things in life.\n\nRecently I have had a lot of improvements in processing my trauma, but whenever I shared it with my gf, it would be taken as misery instead of strides. For example, I was sharing with her today how past few nights I could not sleep because I was up re-examining how tough it was for me back in school while I was still closeted. I did not allow myself space and time to acknowledge how hard it was until 7 years later because only now I am safe enough to actually relive those moments. But she immediately asked me to talk about something \"less sad\".\n\nAny advice on preventing oversharing and protecting your significant other's peace? ",

I now work a desk job doing a lot of environmental government paperwork and it is boring. Fine for now but not for the forever. Not sure what next steps are. Hubby & I plan on no kids till 30.\n\nI was scrolling reddit mindlessly, aimlessly, & read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/s/yNMAilPtCj) (r/depression does not allow cross posts). It made me realize I am depressed. \n\nI thought I was depression proof. I started douloxotine for anxiety Fall 2023 & have already had my dosage increased. It helps with racing thoughts so much. It works much better than Zoloft, which I tried previously. I thought that I was depression proof because I was on anti-depressants.\n\nWhen I wasn\u2019t on them, I would ball my eyes out for hours, want to die, self-harm, etc. Now that I\u2019m on them, I do none of those things!

It\u2019s\u2026 fine. I feel like I barely noticed 1/4 of 2024 go past. But to be fair, I didn\u2019t have any motivation for those things when I was sobbing all the time so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m \u201cworse\u201d now.\n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/s/yNMAilPtCj) made me realize I am depressed. What now? I\u2019m not too deep, it\u2019s more of an \u201capathetic\u201d depression. I can\u2019t afford to go back to therapy right now, although I have some great techniques I learned from EMDR that help me calm down.\n\nHelp me for a game plan for next week to get un-depressed. I will post updates here & hold myself to it, because I\u2019m not emotionally out of control. \n\nIf I were to start, I would be \n- that I need to start drinking (at least) 2 of my 40oz bottles of water per day.\n\nP.S. My job has A LOT of flexibility - which is great - except that I am really falling behind because of all of this. I have trouble getting up in the morning, time management, distraction, motivation, etc. \n\ntl;dr: A Reddit post made me realized I am a little depressed even though I am on a high dose of anti depressants that work. I need a game plan. How should I approach next week on a productive way that will help me get out of this rut? I will be making a game plan and will hold myself to posting updates for a week.",

I don\u2019t think about lunch and dinner; I let the days go by, thinking I\u2019ve eaten enough already. My stomach grumbles, but my head is convinced as if I've eaten enough for the day.

I\u2019ve lost 15 kgs since and so I\u2019m not sure if this is serious or if I\u2019m delusional thinking I\u2019ve got ED?\n\nAlso conscious that i might have mental health issues.. nothing feels right anymore. I have friends and activities that I could keep myself occupied with but I choose to do none of that shit and rot in bed the whole day. Do I think about ending my life? Yes. But can I go through with it? No, because I know I have people around me whom I would hurt\u2026 but if I had the chance to give away my life to someone who deserves it even less than I do, I'd gladly do it because I believe they would see it as a second chance.

Losing friends from murder, suicide, drunk drivers, dealing with a verbally abusive mother, my father was to busy to be around and my siblings not really wanting anything to do with me. I have no friends and I'm not interested in making friends in my area. (I live in a very small town and they are all drunken idiots, just not the life style I want to live.) With all thay being said, I always try and be thay positive person in people's lives, I'm the type of person who will drop everything and be by their side if they need it. The past 3 years, I have been feeling more alone and empty as time goes by, I play games with some people who I met online, but even when I'm around them, I still feel so empty and alone. Any time I try and talk to my parents about how I've been feeling the response usually goes like \"it's all part of being a man. You just have to suck it up and deal with it\". But I have a hard time dealing with it when it's every day I feel like this. I stay up at night often in tears and not being able to sleep, to not wanting to get out of bed in the morning. It sucks too, because I have been there for so many people, but when it comes time for me asking for help or advice, all I hear is crickets, there is no one around other than myself. I have given all my puzzle pieces to help others, and now I feel like I have none to left to help myself. I feel like I'm just here with no purpose. Im lost, I'm alone, and I'm hurting. I don't know what to do anymore. I understand that there are alot of people who have way worse lives than I do. This is just a shortened version on how I have been feeling. ",

        "body": "I'm currently battling a bout of loneliness for the first time in my life. I have been living away from my family for over two years now, they only live half an hour away but I've never felt emotionally safe to express myself around my parents, except to my brother - who is very busy with work lately and I don't have time to talk to him.\n\n1. I just changed jobs, from a hybrid situation where I got to see my colleagues in the office two days a week - to a job where I need to work a night shift with remote colleagues who work in a timezone with a 15 hour difference. Confined to my home 5 days a week with no physical interaction.\n\n2. In the past two years of living away from my family, at least I've still had housemates. First was my cousin, then my ex girlfriend. When my ex and I broke up, she lived in my house for another 8 months till she found a place of her own. I'm now living in a 3-bedroom apartment fully on my own, with nobody to talk to and a boring job that keeps me at my desk. It pays alright and I have more time to hit the gym, so that's my only consolation.\n\n3. I find myself in a blossoming new relationship in the last two months, but my girlfriend is long-distance. We Facetime nearly everyday, but she's normally exhausted after a long day at her work and will be coming back to my city (her home city) in a couple of weeks. Besides her, I have nothing else to be excited about in my life. I know how important self-love is, and to not rely on one person for happiness, so this is not at all a good thing.\n\n4. My old friends have all grown apart, and I am forcing myself to maintain ties with them by having random catch-ups, going out for drinks, or just texting them to say hi. But I can sense that they're either not interested in entertaining me or simply too busy with their own lives. I regret taking for granted the years when I was close to them, to not forge a stronger bond over time. I say this because I feel that most of my friendships have expired since we don't share similar interests/experiences/humour anymore like we used to, and the only \"friends\" I relate to are now the people I work with.\n\n5. I have started going for therapy but it's not been convincing. I need to talk to people who understand me well, and the only people who can - are my brother and my ex. My brother is too busy and when I tried talking to my ex (we're on good terms, platonically), she's always going off about her new boyfriend and of course I'm not keen to listen to my ex about the person she replaced me with.\n\n\nI know that I'm not alone, and that many others are battling the same things here, if not worse. For the record, I AM NOT SUICIDAL, not at all. But I do cry myself to sleep on some nights.\n\nIt was never like this, I used to be full of life in my late-teens and early-20s. People knew me for being the one who brings others together and always has my OWN shit together. I'm known for being independent, intelligent, financially responsible, and very stoic. I'm too afraid to come clean to anyone and ruin that perfect image that they have of me.\n\nI would just like to know what I can do to overcome this heavy feeling in my heart, what hobbies can I pick up, and how others have dealt with the same.",

        "body": "Speaking to my therapist I have realised I will never escape my own situation.\n\nFrankly as 28 F and someone with a large gap in my work resume. I just want a job. Not many opportunities in my city and being also rejected from some of them, it quite hurts. \n\nI am just venting? Ranting? Idk. It is just a monologue. \n\nI guess all these years of self-isolation and being a neet broke me so hard, that even with therapy I do not see a practical solution. My mind just cannot figure out anything. \n\nYeah, I am suffering from depression and I never was a social being either. Something was so repulsive about me, I could never really form friendships or keep aquitances. \n\nIt was either bullying, being ignored or treated with disdain. Present time, I am mostly alone with no drive or motivation to improve. \n\nI wonder if anyone else can relate to what I said. I wanted to start learning again to improve, but I am in a fog and I cannot move forward. \n\nI suppose all of those unhealed traumas and a shitty childhood just destroyed me. \n\nIt would be a miracle for me to ever become a functional adult. Just a small monologue to look back on it. ",

My parents are paying for me to get a college education, all the way across the country, just because I felt like going there. My mom pays my rent so that I can live in this beautiful house with my closest friends while I go to school for whatever I want.\n\nIt feels like all of this is completely wasted on me. I don't deserve all of this opportunity and privilege when I can't muster the energy or courage or anything to DO anything with it. I don't have goals or hopes or dreams, and I never really have. I honestly just don't really want to be here. I feel like I failed to launch as a child, failed to garner any sense of faith in the world and my place in it. Anything I really *try* to do feels disingenuous. I'm just going through the motions and It's all constructed around the shell of a person that I actually am. It's not real, and someone who actually has a real purpose should be in my place instead.\n\nI'm pretending to care, pretending to have plans, pretending to have passions when really I would just lie in bed and starve myself and waste away completely if I could. I get pretty close when left alone for long enough. What pulls me out is always the fear of seeming ungrateful for all of the ways I've been set up for success.\n\nI just don't *want* to succeed, I don't feel that anything I do will have meaning. My friends and family seem to admire me and have faith in me for reasons that aren't actually there or that I just can't see. It is getting to be so exhausting trying to keep up with everyone around me, trying to be as interesting or as productive or as ambitious as my peers when it's all pretend.",

Idk if I am having a crisis or getting depressed, I still don\u2019t know what this is about but okay here is a bit about me, I am 24, I\u2019m a pretty girl that comes from a really good family, I\u2019ve had it almost all, my dad spoils me often because I am his only daughter he really is the best and very patient with me because I have been rebellious. I have escaped my house. I have done so many things that my parents wouldn\u2019t even imagine\u2026 like for example drugs, dated way older men, I\u2019ve stayed out late partied for like a whole week, benders etc. I\u2019ve lived a crazy life specially when I went away for college in NYC and when I lived in Paris. My parents did not know everything I was doing. They did know that I was drinking and they suspected I had a problem but I\u2019d always denied it. I promised I was going to change I did change but eventually I always keep going back to those habits of mine which is being chaotic, doing things for the plot and I really like the party scene a lot. and now I\u2019m 24 and I don\u2019t feel like I have any purpose in life I don\u2019t work (my dad never forced me to btw) because he takes care of me but I feel bad about that too and all I\u2019ve ever wanted is to get married and have kids basically be a housewife because I don\u2019t wanna work and it\u2019s very hard to find a good man these days. I don\u2019t know what I should do like sometimes I am in between either starting a career like start working and just have a normal life like my parents want me to or just go back to New York, go off the rails and live the life I was living before like a rockstar like partying every night sleeping all day spending money doing drugs and just repeat. So it\u2019s either the right path or the wrong path but is it even worth it? To try? Life keeps getting worse these days, these generation sucks, men suck so idk. I\u2019m conflicted and ai feel lost. sometimes I wish there was special someone who would just tell me they would fix me and would be there for me and then I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about all this.

I'm feeling suicidal and hopeless..\r  \n\r  \nLast year, I hit rock bottom and everything fell apart.\r  \n\r  \nIt all started when I made the biggest mistake of my life. I was working in a very stressful job and it impacted my mental health so badly and it started taking a toll on my physical health as well and I decided to quit. After quitting my job, I continued working as a freelancer and took a leap of faith to start my own business despite having no savings. I used my credit cards and my sole trader income tax to fund my business, I worked very hard and did everything I could and I failed.. and now I'm left with credit card debts with a high interest and tax debt which I'm struggling to pay since I'm drowning in credit card debts. This is the root cause of my depression.\r  \n\r  \nAnd then my girlfriend of 5 years left me as I was financially unstable.. I don't blame her.. she deserves someone better and stable. After the breakup, my depressions got so much worse. She was my first love, we lived together for 4 years, and it was the only serious relationship I had.\r  \nShortly after, I got into an accident and broke my right leg, had to get a surgery, and I couldn't walk for months.\r  \n\r  \nAnd then, my best friend of 10 years (and my only friend) who has always been there since we were teenagers ended up dating my ex. I'm completely shattered and we haven't talked again since.. this guy is literally the only person I had left in my life (I have family but they are all back home, I'm an immigrant overseas). I don't know if could ever make a new friend with such a strong bond like I had with this guy, or even make a new friend in general.\r  \n\r  \nDue to this series of f\\*\\*ked up events, I'm so broken and messed up in the head now.\r  \nI'm 30 y/o, with 38k in debt, have no friends and no social life whatsoever. I'm still working as a freelancer so I just work from home and have no colleagues, literally 0 human interaction.\r  \nI tried to get a debt consolidation loan because the credit card interest rate is brutal (23%) so I wanted to get a debt consolidation loan at least with a lower interest rate it would be much more manageable, but didn't get approved because I'm working as a freelancer and I have no assets. I tried everything but there seems to be no way out..\r  \n\r  \nI just feel so tired of living this way.. I used to be such a happy person... and now I feel like I've been in the darkness for so long that I don't even remember the last time I felt happy, like genuinely smiling and laughing, it's been so so long :( and I really miss that feeling. And now I'm carrying so much mental burdens and I started having suicidal thoughts and it really scares me.. I wish I could just sleep and never wake up again.. I'm not sure how much longer I can go on this like this.. I'm just so.. exhausted...",

Depression kicked my ass and I rotted for a few years doing nothing. I dropped out of highschool and things downward spiraled into extreme isolation. I was never an ambitious kid. It wasn't until I suffered severe humiliation by one of my family members that I began to push myself forward. I got busy but was always a bit off mentally. I would do embarrassing things that were deemed awkward. I had a horrible time communicating. All those years I spent away from society came back to hurt me. Although I got through it, I find myself in limerence. Somehow unable to believe anything is real.  In a way I am lonely. I miss the rotting stage where I could just pretend I had no responsibilities. Sometimes although I feel so much love for my family and friends, a switch goes off and I hate everyone. I always feel like nobody understands me. I still feel like I'm at the cusp of reaching adulthood despite being so behind. I never had a real solid job. In a way I am scared. Scared of never living and working endlessly to distract myself. I know I should be happy to have accomplished so much but I feel so detached. The sounds of my childhood that used to bring me great comfort, feel like a distant memory that no longer belong to me. Everything feels so fresh and new almost like I woke up from a coma.

        "body": "idek why, it\u2019s kind of random. I hate my skin and I feel so unmotivated when it comes to that and other areas of my life. earlier I was thinking about a hypothetical future of my life being more put together, when I realized, \u201cthat\u2019s never going to happen. I\u2019m never going to a. get hired for or b. be able to perform a job that\u2019s more difficult than my job now (doesn\u2019t pay much)\u201d. I just feel apathetic towards a lot of things and the only reason I\u2019m still going is because I have too much anxiety to stop. just thinking about my situation getting better is so tiring and it just seems like too much effort to actually live the life I want (wanted?) to live. I also keep thinking about how there were so many resources wasted on me and how I don\u2019t deserve to live because of certain health conditions I have (among other things) and how I wish I could transfer all of that to a healthy person so that it is not just a waste of food, money, and a college degree. \n\nbut I keep thinking about things I could do to prep people for when I\u2019m gone, possible ways of doing it, and what their reactions would be. timing too - do I drift away slowly and hope no one really notices? should I stage it as a runaway? do I actually just run away and try to start a new life? I just can\u2019t stop picturing a world that I am no longer apart of. sometimes when I do things, I randomly think about how this might be the last time I do them and the quote I heard about, \u201cone time you do something or see someone will be the last, but at the time you probably won\u2019t know it\u201d. sometimes I feel apathetic, but sometimes I feel genuinely sad. I saw a video of a couple who lost their daughter and just looking at them made me not want to cause the same pain to my parents. idk what to do or where to go from here.",

This girl broke up with me and I ruined everything. It was all my fault and I spent 7 months of my life with her. She was amazing but she hates me now. She spread lies and rumors all across the school that weren't true and i everyone has resorted to bullying me and destroying me. I've always been a fairly happy guy on the outside but I've always been struggling with depression. I feel like I have no value in other people's lives so I feel like I basically have no choice but to end it all. They say time heals but as time has gone on, my life has gotten worse and worse. My family doesn't care about me. I know a lot of people feel that way but If I ran away right now they wouldn't notice I was missing. I serve no purpose in other people's lives. I don't even talk anymore. I hardly eat. My life is falling apart and I haven't even got married yet. There is truly nobody that cares about me and I mean that. That girl was the only one who cared about me at all, and ever since she's been gone I've been so alone. I'm sorry if you guys think this all bs or whatever and its okay if you don't take it seriously ( I don't expect anyone to ) but I truly feel that as more time goes on I may resort to just ending my life.

        "body": "Been in love with the same girl for almost 2 years. I haven\u2019t gone a single day without thinking of her. I never told her how I felt. It\u2019s too late now because she doesn\u2019t even remember who I am. Which is understandable because we literally only talked one time. She also lives states away from me. I met her on Omegle when I was 14. Over a week after my birthday. I turn 16 in 2 months. We talked for probably an hour about all kinds of stuff. I even remember some things. She talked about Indiana because she lives there and about how some former Colts players children lived in a house in her neighborhood. I talked to her about Philadelphia because I live about an hour away from there. I can\u2019t remember all that much unfortunately. But around the end of the conversation. She had the best smile I\u2019ve ever seen. She said \u201cyou\u2019re cute\u201d. I didn\u2019t really respond because at the time I had no idea I was in love yet. She then gave me her Instagram and left quickly because her dad came home. I messaged her the next day saying \u201cHi it\u2019s me from Omegle\u201d. She never responded or read the message. But I was able to figure out she didn\u2019t really use Instagram at the time because she only had a few post and wasn\u2019t online. But I guess she forgot about me since she never thought to check the next day. Still not knowing I was in love, I shrugged it off and moved on till about a few weeks later. I was scrolling through her posts and  I had a weird feeling I never felt before. Deep down I knew I was in love, but I kept denying it to myself because I didn\u2019t want love at the time. Till eventually that \u201cweird feeling\u201d became strong love. Life felt amazing for the first time in a long time. I never had the courage to try and message her again, I just looked at her pictures all day and listened to music. Sometime around February I think, I had the courage to do it. I said \u201cIt\u2019s been awhile since we talked, you probably don\u2019t even remember me\u201d. This time, she actually responded almost instantly. She responded with the most hurtful word ever. \u201cok\u201d. I was just in shock. I never responded and don\u2019t plan to. I just dropped my phone and walked away from it. For the first time ever, I felt my heart sink and break. It was around 7pm and it was a school night so I got a shower. I remember actually hitting the floor and crying saying quietly \u201cI love her\u201d. So cringe of me. I was mentally broken for a very long time I can\u2019t remember how long. But eventually, I actually got over it. Till sometime in early 2023 I\u2019d say. I was looking through my old messages and saw our conversation. And guess what happened? Yup, back in love. It\u2019s now March 23rd, 2024 and I haven\u2019t gone a single day without thinking about her. She started posting again all kinds of pictures with her and friends. Earlier this month, I couldn\u2019t handle it anymore. I made like 4 or 5 portraits of her in like 2 hours with text saying how much I love her. I know what area she lives in, her school, her sport, her friends, her parents names and photos, even her grandmother. I looked through every social media app known to man and found a couple more apps she uses. I have filled my camera roll with like 70 photos of her recently. I used google maps to see how far of a drive it is from my house to her area. It\u2019s about 11 hours. I have debated many times running away to see her, but I never will of course. I have become a complete stalker. I have lost myself worse than ever this time. I also don\u2019t fear she won\u2019t like me, it just because she lives so far away. I\u2019m not bragging I swear but I\u2019m not an ugly person. I\u2019ve been asked out many times but I never liked them back. I also learned she\u2019s in a grade higher than me. I\u2019m a freshmen and she\u2019s a sophomore. Only because I was held back when I was younger because I didn\u2019t do my work as a kid. We would have been in the same grade. But it\u2019s not a huge difference. I\u2019ve also been having really bad thoughts of ending my life over her. I am so pathetic I know. But that\u2019s not the worst part. I had a thought to myself thinking \u201cIf I can\u2019t be in love with her, no one can\u201d. I won\u2019t go into detail about this because it still scares me of what my other thoughts were about what I said there. I\u2019ve had so many panic attacks and mental breakdowns over her. I remember about a week after I met her, I told myself I\u2019d never be able to see her. I then had my first ever mental breakdown. Lots of people I feel like would just say to me \u201cIt\u2019s just your first love\u201d that is true, but this is almost more than that. Now I\u2019m aware I have never met her in real life, but I know for a fact she is such a great person. I still remember the date, day and time the conversation ended, from my memory. May 27th, 2022 10:34 pm. I\u2019ll never forget this date ever. I really only remember this because I took a screenshot of her Instagram she typed in the chat and the both of us on camera. I can write so much more honestly to this story there\u2019s so much more and it just gets worse to where I am today. I hope someone can try and help me. I\u2019ve tried hotlines and I\u2019m always out on hold for way too long. I hate asking for help, but I\u2019m desperate at this point. I\u2019ve also developed anger issues lately due to all of this. I am also not using my name or anything like that because I don\u2019t want people to recognize me, even though idk anyone who uses this platform that I know. Lots of people look up to me and I don\u2019t want them to see me like this. I\u2019ve got a really bright future ahead of me and a great personality, but none of this matters at the moment. When I think of her, I\u2019m a nobody. Those are only some of my inner thoughts that I have. \nAnyways like I was saying, someone please help me. I don\u2019t want therapy because I don\u2019t want my parents to see who I really have been for the past 2 years. I hope someone can comment. ",

Except if the boy i like asks me to meet. Then there's a spring in my body and i quickly freshen up. I need something essential. Essential to me. I want to give my life meaning again. \n\n",

I struggle to save and make good financial decisions. I dont like change and havent left my barista job in years. I struggle to keep up relationships and would rather be left alone. I went from being a track athlete, with a boyfriend, healthy and thin, future thought out to now 5 years later diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses, only achieving an associates degree, no man or want for one, no real goals and getting bigger everyday. I genuinely cant believe how fast things deteriorated. I still put on a good front. I am good at my job, rent is cheap, parents are good and I live with them and my sister, one good friend. I dont show my sadness to anyone (most of the time) i am high functioning. But inside im crumbling and in constant sadness with my situation. I feel like im losing time and I wont be able to do any of the things I thought I would do. I feel like I have already failed before my life has truly began. I dont even want to die I just want to escape or even just start over. But sadly neither is possible. Why was I subjected to being a human. Its such a cruel life.",

My dumbass was high at the time and didn't look up reviews. Looking at them now, a lot of people were using the app for urgent care...I wasn't so that's why I'm posting this here to find out other experiences with their mental health options.\n\nI signed up, went through the whole thing of downloading the app & talking to the healthcare professional. This was $50 up front. I couldn't tell if the woman I was talking to was AI or not?? She texted me a wall of text after about 30 seconds lol bc I know it had to be copy+paste or AI. That's fine and all, but something was just off, especially when it came to sounding like a real human. All the texts were formatted like chaptgpt lmao. But she had a picture & credentials so who knows.\n\nAnyway she ended up telling me I'm not fit for the program bc my PCP is prescribing me ambien and I can re-enroll later. She didn't even give me the option to tell her I'd be willing to give up the ambien if she was able to prescribe me something else. So basically she told me bye after maybe only 15 minutes.\n\nI take all the blame for wasting my own money, it was my own fault for not reading the reviews. I'm just really trying to find out if sis was AI or not lol\n\n&#x200B;",

I had a bunch of interviews and I\u2019m still not sure if I want to leave or not. I am still in my hometown where I\u2019ve lived on my life, and I do not have a good reputation, because in the past, I have not chosen to be a good person and struggled very severely with mental health issues and lack of self-awareness. I need to get out of my hometown. I want to restart my life. I am only halfway done with a bachelors degree and I think I want to finish that so that I can have a career I\u2019m proud of before I\u2019m too old. My life needs to change if you were in a situation like mine what would you do? Obviously I have the answers I need inside, but have you ever felt like your whole entire life needs to change in order for you to be the person that you\u2019re meant to be? Do you know how uncomfortable I feel right now in every aspect of my life? It\u2019s not easy to start over especially when you\u2019re poor and have no friends or family to support you. ",

My car was older so I got around 4k for it and just dropped 11k on a new car. I was feeling mentally out of it all month. I\u2019m not the type to wear my emotions on my sleeve I\u2019m bad at expressing it but people at work noticed. They asked if I was okay many times . My mentor (I\u2019m an apprentice at a body shop) noticed my mental decline. I no longer want to work. I don\u2019t care as much. I was still functioning after my mental hospital visit which was 3 days after the wreck and breakup. My ex is improving her life and herself smoothly and I am not. This week has been the worst. Week 6 on Effexor and I can\u2019t stop crying all day long. I\u2019m in so much pain. I miss my girlfriend I miss my dog and my cat I miss my home. I feel so lost and broken. I\u2019ve been through sooo much to be so young and I don\u2019t know what to do. My ex doesn\u2019t want to see me and has blocked me out for good for her own well being and I just miss my home and my family . It\u2019s not fair, I can\u2019t grow good living with my recovered addict of a dad. He\u2019s cool and all but I\u2019m not doing so well. \nThe past week my room has been digusting. I cannot stand to be awake. I\u2019ve never felt this low before and I struggle from bipolar MDD anxiery etc. so I\u2019m used to be depressed but this is something different . I come home from work take a nap wake up eat dinner , slam an ambien or two , sleep, ambien wakes me up at 4 am on the dot so I get up and go into the shop and work alone. My name is on the lease of the apartment but I already committed to going to my dads and she\u2019s doing so well I can\u2019t just come in and demand shit because she\u2019s a bit of a narcissist and hard to reason with so it\u2019ll just go up in flames and I won\u2019t win. Cant afford to live there alone if she left anyways after just dropping my whole savings on a car. I was so numb the last few weeks until now and I don\u2019t know how much more I can take ",

I've tried going to the gym but haven't been able to stick with it. I'm very busy and I hate myself and I never expected to live past 21 so I never took care of myself, nor did my parents instill working out or good eating as a regular habit of mine (they've been extremely stressed and regret not doing it, it's not like they're lazy or anything like that, honestly they're amazing people). But I fucking hate the way I look, I hate the fact that I'm so unnatractive, and I hate that I can't even muster the will to pick up a fucking weight. So I'm going to starve myself. Not now, but about 6 months from now when I enter into the college dorms after highschool. I'll be on my own and no one can stop me, and I can do it without stressing my parents or family. If I get skinny, great, I don't care if it's unhealthy. If I die from it, also fucking great, I don't care (I know it's a lot harder to starve yourself to death but who knows). I'm just posting this because I can't tell anyone else about it. I'll be covered in cuts and scars in college, so might as well have a nom shitty body to do it on. At this point, I don't fucking care. I don't have trauma, I have a loving family, and my whole life I've been a dissapointment who's had everything handed to him. I'm told I'm incredible and almost everything I've done is far beyond what most people my age do, but when you've had so much help along the way, it's no longer an achievement to take pride in, but is just another example of how fucking worthless I am. The only thing I can take pride in is that I listen well to other people's problems, and helping them is the one thing that truly makes me feel some meaning, but it's short lived and honestly fucking trivial, it doesn't fucking matter. I know this is bullshit and stupid, that I have no reason to be doing any of this, but my brain has decided otherwise and any positive self image died years ago, so I really don't fucking care.

        "body": "I'm about to talk about my struggles in finding help. Please don't read if I might accidentally trigger you.\n\nYesterday I filled out one of the DBT diary cards honestly. You know what I really don't understand? Nowhere you go seems to understand that there's a difference between having suicidal ideation thoughts and actively acting on them.\n\nHow can I heal if you don't allow me to be honest? And I having those thoughts? Yeah have had them for a very long time. Shortly after I turned 18 I believe.\n\nBut if you dare tell any medical professional that they're going to immediately want to toss you in the loony bin or take the liability off of their hands. They approached me after the group therapy was over. And asked me about why I had filled the diary card out the way I did.\n\nAnd I was honest. I said I have all these feelings in my head and I have no one to talk to about them. Group therapy isn't meant to be individual therapy, they made that clear at the start of class. And my therapist and psychiatrist have all but given up on me. Basically telling me to seek help on my own somewhere else. No I'm not joking.\n\nSo I told the group therapist yeah I feel really abandoned. I've got all these thoughts building up in my head and nowhere for them to go. But that doesn't mean I'm going to act on them. I told them I really could use help finding a therapist. It's hard to find the right one and sometimes that takes several tries to find that person that works well with you.\n\nI feel so downhearted. Because as soon as I told them I wasn't a threat to myself and they wouldn't be liable for me feeling the way I am, they just said well very good then be on your way. No regards to what I was asking for. Which was please help me find a new therapist. Is this not a mental health clinic?\n\nSo when people say that there is help out there I'm failing to believe it. I mean here I am sticking my neck out asking for help and it seems to me all they care about is liability. Well if she actively hurts herself who's responsible? Well even if I were going to actively hurt myself, I certainly wouldn't tell anybody that. That part just baffles me. Don't most people who have a plan to hurt themselves avoid doing that?\n\nNo that is not what I'm doing. I'm asking for help because I don't want to feel this way. But alas I see I am alone. There isn't any help out there that I have found yet. It's hard.",

I've been in therapy for over 2 years now and i've recovered a bit from that but i always relapse and now i'm depressed. I'm a queer teen, have gotten into one relationship which was abusive which i left but now i feel like i'm missing out on the teen experience because i've got all the odds against me. My mom cried for a week and didn't speak to me for a week when i came out as well. \nNow i just spend my nights bed rotting, i hide to my friends the real symptoms of my disorder and i'm starting to isolate myself from everyone. I hate it but i can't help it because I just feel like I only feel kind of ok when I'm alone in the dark doing nothing.\nI'm in a special class with more hours than the regular course because of options and said options are the only things motivating me to go to school but everyday is harder. I can't get myself out of bed in the morning before school, if i can shower before forcing myself out of my home i'm shocked at myself and i just want to sleep during class because i struggle with insomnia as well. I try n hit the gym after school but i'm severly overwhelmed by my day at school and tend to just go home, feel guilty then end up bingeing. It's like 2am rn and I'm laying on the floor of my room because my bed is overwhelming my senses (idek why) and I'm just crying because tomorrow is going to be the same, over and over again. \nAnyway i'm not rly seeking advice or anything bc my therapist is great and ion have any suicidal thoughts or anything, i just needed to vent\n",

But it also means that I feel physical pain, and lately I have been having nightmares about being kidnapped and abused or tortured (or even SA:d), and the torture is not mild. Last night I had three consecutive dreams with the same storyline but I got kidnapped by different people two times and experienced pain in all three. One example of the things that happened in my dream last night was getting holes drilled all the way down to the roots of all my teeth, and although the pain is not on the level it would be in real life, it still hurts really bad. As I remember it, the pain was similar to one I felt during a dentist appointment that left me scared of dentists.\n\nI wake up with no pain in my body, but I become mentally affected. It adds to my distress, and I can imagine the pain when I think about the dreams. It stresses me out and I hate going to sleep knowing that I might get tortured in my dreams again. Ik it might sound dumb or lame but I have no idea where those dreams come from and why I have them, I have had similar dreams for most of what I remember of my life, but never often enough for it to feel like an issue.\n\nI hope these nightmares stop soon, I usually don\u2019t have those when I am not stressed, but they add to my stress and mental weight, and right now sleep is turning into another point of stress for me instead of letting me rest and it is not helping my already unstable mind :/\n\nJust a lil rant, it doesn\u2019t feel like something that can just be fixed but if anyone else experiences this I would love to know, because I feel so alone with it and don\u2019t know how to cope with them\n\nI already feel stuck and lost in real life, I don\u2019t want to feel stuck and lost in my dreams too, they used to be an escape and something I actually looked forward to",

        "body": "This is my second time ever really venting, ive tried a therapist but i have to get my parents involved with it so i just didn't. I've been having these thoughts ever since I was around 10-13 and ever sice my parents divorce my depression has become \"active\". \n\nAround when I was 11 or 12 I had this big group of online friends that lasted 2 years. We had this big minecraft world that we named caca town. I loved everything about, every day I would be so excited to be on talking with them. Then there was this event that ruined everything. This one guy joined and told lies to everyone. No one believed it but after a while it started to get into one of their skins. It dug into them and they didn't know what to think, then he eventually believed it then left. I don't know what happened to him but they said he killed himself. After that \"he\"was kicked out for ruining everything. After that I started getting these thoughts about how I could of done more to fix this, how I could of saved him. I still remeber the world like it happened tomorrow. I eventually just pushed all of them away so that I don't ruin their creation any more. My first betrayal was him joining and doing this.\n\nThen at school I had some money that some of my friends knew about. I didn't think anything about it until one of them took it. He wasn't good at lying. It was only 60$ but I knew I should stay away from him. So I pushed him away. My second betrayal.\n\nThen after a while before the second time I had made this other group of online friends. It started out super good. Everything was perfect, it was all I ever wanted. After a while i started to feel off about the new people that joined, but I just thought that It was me thinking about the past, so I let them join. After a while people started going with them. Is my group not fun? Is it me? I don't know. But everyone started to disband. Me and 3 other people were really left. Then it was 2 other. I thought this was all I needed so I didn't really do anything about it. Then one of my friends wanted to talk to the other friend that disbanded, it sounded like he wanted to talk to him, it really did. So i eventually got him to talk to him. This was my worst mistake, this time it was really my fault. He said the worst things to him, telling him about how much he hated him how much he felt like he was a disappointment. I was struck in the heart, my closest friend saying this to him. He was so sad after this. So I pushed every one away, it's the thing I'm best at \ud83d\ude03. I cried myself to sleep that day. Then he talks to me like nothing happened. I'm disgusted at myself and him. My third betrayal.\n\nI  didn't have a good relationship with my mom. I never really did, all she did was work, Water the garden, and was on her phone. She really only took care of us when she has to. There was also these times when my dad told me about things she did in the past, these were hard to believe because she basically was barely in my life. But now I believe about anything bad he says because I heard her talking about the things my dad said about her. My dad tried getting a divorce with her a long time ago but didn't have enough evidence so nothing really happened. Now I just don't really talk to her any more. Everything was going normally. I thought things were gong better. But then my dad told me about something my did a while ago. I won't be telling what he said but I was devastated. How could you not care about us, and do bad things. The divorce is still being figured out but I know where I'm going. I feel disgusted when i talk to her, she's the one person next to me that i want dead. Fourth betrayal?\n\nThere is also this other event that was completely my fault but I won't be saying.\n\nAll I can think about is how I could have done better, how things could have changed if I did something else. I cared too much, now I don't care about anything.\n\nI'm only alive because of my dad. I love him for taking care of us and loving us. I just can't make him sad by killing myself, I would be such a bigger disappointment then I already am. My siblings also can't have a dead oldest brother, who would they look up too? They cant, they would be looking down at my grave.\n\nNow I'm just pushing everything into my big sad balloon, keeping everything hidden from the people I know. I've spent so long making and designing my sad balloon. But eventually it will pop, because you can never fill a balloon with too much air.",

Also, I don't know if it will be of any importance, but before Miravil I was taking another medication, but it also didn't work. \nAnyway, the problem I struggle with right now, other than all the other stuff, is my weird dreaming situation. Lately I've been having really realistic dreams, but I feel like they have gotten worse. After waking up I have no idea if a day passed or not, even if my dream had some bizarre elements, it all feels real. I feel like I can't trust my memories, I also feel a bit detached from reality.\nIs it anything serious? Should I tell my psychiatrist? Did anyone of you struggle with something similar, and if so, was it anything serious? (not asking you to diagnose me, just curious about the causes for other people.) \nThanks in advance for any responses. \n",

I was living with my mom but some heavy shit went down & one of my older brothers offered me to move in with him & his family knowing I had no income and was waiting for my disability to get approved. I agreed to watch my two nephews while my brother & his wife work.. I have a dog, an older chihuahua who is my best friend. She\u2019s helped me so much mentally since I got her in 2020 from a couple who just didn\u2019t want her anymore. She deserves the best life ever. Well, she\u2019s running out of dog food and I have no income. A kind lady on Facebook offered to buy me some if I could pick it up from her house 14 mins away from where I live. My brother drives through the town she is in on his way home from work every day, so I asked him if he could pick it up for me on his way home but he said no. So I\u2019m not really sure what to do. I\u2019ve been struggling so hard since I was 13, which I had to raise myself from then till I was 18. I try so hard to keep my head floating above the water but every day it just goes deeper. None of my siblings will help me out, I don\u2019t ask for money at all. I usually just find stuff I need on free sites on Facebook but I can\u2019t ever get a ride to pick anything up because they all clearly make up excuses not to take me or grab it when they\u2019re in that specific town. I\u2019m slowly giving up. My dog deserves better, I love her so much but if I can\u2019t even figure out how to get her dog food then I probably need to find her a home that can give her the life she deserves. I\u2019m just worthless. I even give my brother most of the food stamps I get as a thank you for letting me stay with him so I barely even have food to feed myself. Me being born was a mistake (my mom was r4ped) so yeah life is really showing me just how much of a mistake I am. ",

        "body": "I've been struggling with a depressive episode since late august. There are bright days and there are dark days and I thought I was over the peak but I can feel the darkness creeping back towards me and this catalyst of a intrusive thought keeps running across my mind and thats that my life really has no baring on any others. For some context, in September I broke things off with my romantic partner who I was deeply in love with in fear of things going south, I remained freinds temultuously with her until january until I decided it was just hurting me too much and cut things off, she was my only really close friend. I have a few friends but I have a tendency to shell myself off from people and don't feel super connected to them. My family I've never felt super connected to either even though I'm sure they'd be upset if I was gone. I try to enjoy simple pleasures and being on my own but obviously being depressed this isn't easy. I don't really know why I'm posting this other than to vent but if anybody has anything encouraging to tell me I'd like to hear it. ",

        "body": "(TW Self-harm and suicidal thoughts mention)\n\nDoes depression ever go away? I've had periods of time where things feel okay, and I feel like I've reached the surface of the water and I know where things are and what to do. And it's been nearly a year since I last engaged in self-harm. And I do not feel suicidal anymore, because I have things I want to do and people I want to see. But ever so often these depressing feelings or whatever just come back. This empty sort of feeling in my chest and the feeling that I need to cry- but I'm unable to. The hole in my chest is always there. Taking the path of just giving up on life and rotting away until the end of my life is always somewhere in there. I do not want to be alone with my thoughts, yet socializing is so frustrating and consumes all of my energy.\n\nI've lost track of time. Or rather, I lost it a long time ago. The days just merge together. I can't put my finger on when things happened and I keep forgetting everything that happens. I turn 18 later this year which makes me a legal adult. The depressive episodes have been on and off since I was in elementary. Still, it feels like a couple of years ago.\n\n There's this feeling I'm never really present, as well. My physical body is there, but I still don't feel like I'm really *there*..? Like I'm just watching stuff happen. And responding on autopilot. Is it even me controlling my own body?\n\nYet there's still some kind of comfort to this loneliness, this emptiness- where I'm isolated from everyone else. On days where I feel better, I don't know who I am. I don't know who I am without my sadness. I can't identify myself and who I am as a person. What do I bring to people who know me? Who am I in their life? My mind is a mess... I feel like I've lost myself.",

Nothing seems to be working. I didn't go to the last psychologists since they were asking 25,000 rupees for 12 sessions which I found it to be expensive. \n\nI have tried to workout, by work is kinda hectic and I am unable to wake up early because I sleep late and this has become a cycle. I tried to bulk because of my skinny structure but it seems after trying to gain some muscle, I have got cholestrol and prediabetes. This really demotivated me to eat anything. Plus, whenever I am stressed at work I just don't eat at all. I completely skip my breakfast/lunch many days. \n\nComing to work \n\nI am one of the worst performer. In my last company, I was removed from my project because of my bad performance. However I managed to secure a job in another company but I feel like I am repeating the same mistake again. I am a developer with literally no skills cheating my manager as well as myself. Whenever I become stressed because of work, I turn off all the notifications and don't respond till evening. It seems some people have already started pointing out. I am 2018 graduate with 2.5 years gap. 3 years of total experience but still fail to understand many things in programming. Whereas graduates from 2021,22 are performing way better than me both in my current as well as previous organization. Because of my demotivation, I am putting way less efforts and gets dejected when they perform better/do the given tasks. \n\nTablets tried : \n\nLithium, Nexito 5, Olazapine, Newcita plus etc \n\nI don't know where to proceed, tried posting in many subs but it gets removed. Now my suicidal thoughts have become so high. \n\nHobbies : I don't have any. My parents never encouraged to take up sports or dance/singing. I grew up as an introvert. I just don't know what to do. I feel like I am just bad at everything. Zero in academics because too many arrears, zero in work because of myself, zero in extra curricular activities partly because of myself. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

I want to end everything including my parents life but I doubt whether I will be able to finish everything as my hands always start shivering under pressure.\nThe fact that I can control just 10% of brain makes it difficult to show interest in things that once made me happy and to stop myself to from ending everything.

Those states last a couple weeks to months for me. \n\nIn case anyone\u2019s curious - I do talk therapy with EMDR weekly and I am on setraline. I workout 3-4 times a week and have a full time job. These states tend to happen when there\u2019s not a lot going on in my life. My therapist thinks when I\u2019m not going at 100 miles an hour, I have \u201ctoo much time\u201d to think / overthink.  \n\nJust curious if anyone else has experience this before. ",

At the sometime, I started experiencing Depersonalization/Derealization like symptoms. In the past months, I had been in and out of the ER, Neuro ect. I've had CT scans, and MRI and didn't get any answer. My scans were just unremarkable. We think i somehow injured myself in the gym but we dont know anything for sure. The truth is my mind is stuck in existential thought mode and I'm truly falling apart. It feels like apart of me just died when this started. I am so sad, all the time. I feel like I don't have a future because I am in so much pain.  The headache has gotten better but psychologically I feel like ive been losing my shit for months and I just want it to stop. I want my life back, I just want to be able to smile, laugh and not feel this way. I don't know when or if I will ever feel like myself again. Its just so hard, and I'm tired of constantly being in this existential thought mode. I feel like ive tapped into something that nobody else can see, when i knows its not really the case. I'm tired of looking down at my arms, and forgetting im real. Im tired of not being able to sleep and pondering why i was put on this planet twenty four seven. I hate seeing the look of my loved ones faces when i wake up in the same funk every morning. I'm tired of feeling like im drowning. Before this started, I was in the best shape, mentally and physically. I had no mental problems, no serious anxiety and it just hit me. Its been months and I just want to like myself. On top of everything, I tried to distract myself and fill the void forming within me and put myself out there a girl at my college. I was just being lead on, as she agreed to go out and was constantly flirting, when in reality had a boyfriend and was just trolling me the entire time. At this point, I don't have a job, only a few friends. I dont even feel like picking up my guitar and playing. Im just so broken, and i feel so alone. I've never had any issues like this until the past months. My mind was always a safe spot for me, even if there was something physically going on with me. But this is just torture. The truth is i dont even know why im making this post. Like it could some how magically help me. I just feel hopeless. ",

And I\u2019ll be frustrated about having to do \u201cnormal\u201d sociable things when I don\u2019t find them enjoyable or important.\n\nI\u2019ve been managing to contain and suppress these frustrations but just as recently as yesterday I\u2019ve been having out-of-character outbursts/conflicts with others due to my own thoughts, feelings, and opinions on important or unimportant matters.\n\nAnd now I\u2019m at the point where I don\u2019t even wanna discuss any of my ideas with anyone because I feel as though it\u2019s a trivial pursuit if I\u2019m just going to constantly be disagreed with and shut down. I don\u2019t need validation or confirmation on my opinions, so there\u2019s no point in even bringing them up. I\u2019m more at peace with what I know personally vs what others think of me. The main issue is that I feel like I HAVE to engage in these types of conversations just to maintain my social rapport and keep my relationship with business partners afloat\n\nI can understand that talking about how \u201cnobody understands me\u2026\u201d or \u201ceverybody disagrees with my opinions\u2026.\u201d can come off as corny or even pretentious, I am aware of that and can understand if anybody feels that way from reading this. But the bottom line is that I just wanna understand what my current issue is.\n\nI feel way more frustrated than I do sad, but I do feel a sense of hopelessness in the form of \u201cthere\u2019s no point of even talking\u201d which is where my confusion on what I\u2019m feeling is coming from. If anyone has any ideas on what this could be or any advice on how to deal with or manage it, a response would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",

I knew what I was doing was wrong but I felt somehow disconnected from it until recently.\n\nI could never kill myself but I want to die every waking moment. I don\u2019t even want to try to get better because I don\u2019t feel like I deserve redemption and I\u2019ll never be able to right the wrongs I\u2019ve done. Even if I manage to feel better one day, the knowledge of what I\u2019ve done will always be a stain on my existence. I had everything going for me and I ruined it for absolutely no reason. I used to think of myself as a good person and now I\u2019m the exact person I would despise. I have no mental illness that could excuse me from it either, all of my mental problems are a direct result of my own actions. How do I even continue? ",

Because I know that, overall, it changes **nothing**. \"Maybe if I write down my thoughts it will become a little bit easier?\" I vent, I cry, I scream, I hate myself, I ask questions and receive no answers. Because there are **no** answers. Anything I do, overall, DOES NOT MATTER. I've been struggling with clinical depression for more than 10 years. I think it's actually 15, but I am not sure. My \"friends\" mock me and say it's not a real thing. My parents mock me and say I just lazy and everything will become better once I get married. Gee, bro, not sure if I am really viewed as a potential husband for the past 7 or so years! Doctors don't do shit except ask for more and more money like I am a fucking ATM machine that prints money.\n\nKa-ching. Here, another 1000 $, take it.\n\nTrust me, I tried. And tried, and tried and tried and tried\n\nMy life WON'T improve. \n\nAnd you kno... I can live with depression. I am a big boy, I can struggle, a lot of people struggle. A lot of people have no food or live on the streets or overall they live in worst conditions than me, so I should be grateful. What annoys the hell out of me is everything else beyond that depression. EVERYTHING in my life is a fucking mess and I have zero control over it. I live in a god-awful shithole of a country with no money and no means to escape. My health is trash and my attempts to fix it are laughable. The only person who actually tried to help me- I pushed them away, because I don't want them to suffer alongside. I don't think I was wrong but I miss having care and support. My cats are sick and I am so, so tired of being stressed, scared and feeling helpless. I wanted to become an artist, but, hah, of course NO ONE CARES. Sure, I don't draw for \"likes\" and \"views\", I love drawing for the sake of it, loved it since I was a little kid, but if no one sees it? No one interacts with it? What's the point? I can just draw it and never show to anyone. Here goes my dream of earning a living by doing what I love, lmao, guess I'll try in the next life! No, seriously, I know I am not some hot 100k followers artist but I never earned a single dollar with my art.\n\nEvery day it's something new. Every fucking day. I wake up and wonder \"hm what's that gonna be?\". You never know!\n\nOne day I got attacked in the shop, just minding my own bussiness. Another day I got attacked when I was throwing away garbage. I can never relax, I can barely sleep, my neighbours annoy the hell out of me with their noise. And somehow every time everyone around me twist like I AM the bad guy. \"You can't fight back!\" \"You can't criticize others!!\" \"Just shut up and struggle\". And sometimes I think, what even the point of my attempts? Every time I try to fix something or improve quality of my life, I fail miserably. I feel like \"Truman Show\" character, and audience watches me struggle and laughs at me while eating Cheetos. Hope you are having a great time, don't think this show gets renewed.\n\nSometimes I think how much better my life would have been if I was born in a different country. Maybe I would have met different people. Good people who were kind to me and didn't make me hate humanity as a whole. What if my parents weren't absolute sociopaths that ruined mental health. Huh.\n\nI am done. This \"life\" thing is a pathetic joke. Not funny, didn't laugh.",

        "body": "I guess this is just me venting, as any friends or family would see this and start worrying like crazy.  I (42M) have had depression and anxiety my entire life.  As a kid, we didn't know what it was (especially in the black community).  I was just seen as \"something is wrong with me\".  I've always been introverted and sensitive.  With that, I have never had a positive view of myself, and low self-esteem was/is normal for me.  \n\nFast forward to today.  Divorced, 3 kids (13M, 10M, 3F), and just depressed as hell.  My 3yo was a happy surprise, and she keeps me on my toes.  She and her mom live with me, but the relationship with her mom is pretty much just roommates and co-parenting.  \n\nOn the outside, it looks like I don't have a reason to complain.  When I look at it, I really don't have a reason to complain, but my brain chemistry just won't allow me to be happy.  I've been on meds for years, did TMS Therapy, and that worked to help me not have the doom feeling all the time.  That also reduced my suicide ideation a ton.  What they, or therapy, haven't fix is that I don't care about myself, and I don't even know how.\n\nThere's been a series of events, especially in the last 6 months, that when all added together just broke me.  Most of it happening around me, and to the people I love.  It has me to the point where I don't have the capacity to pursue any romantic relationship ever again.  Once my daughter gets out of daycare, her mom will be able to afford to live on her own, then we can share custody.  I will miss not having my daughter with me everyday, but her mother deserves WAY better than what I'm not giving her.  I can't love her the way she deserves to be love, or anyone else ever again for that matter.  I just want to be single for the rest of my life.  I could care less about intimacy because I can take care of myself without the need to have performance anxiety, sweat because I'm fat, blah blah blah.\n\nI don't know how to \"love me\" and don't think I want to.  I just want to keep myself alive and employed to take care of my kids.  I don't want to traumatize them by taking my life, that part scares the shit out of me and I love them too much.  I can play the long game of appearing like I'm okay for them, my job, family and friends.  I have to do that because I refuse, REFUSE to burden anyone with my feelings about me.  I've faked it for 42 years, and just have to fake it until my daughter is an adult, and then I can really be done.\n\nI'm just gonna stop here because this could be a book lol.  I kind of just wanted an outlet because people in my life will never understand.",

My ex-wife has moved my kids 3 hours away, and with child support being one of my usual expenses, I can barely afford to visit them. She has recently talked about wanting to move them from PA to Illinois for the sake of her family, to which I said absolutely not. Well, it seems that I am the bad guy now, since all of the sudden my kids have this urge to want to move there. They've never mentioned it once before, and now they won't even talk to me...no returning my calls or replying to my texts.\n\nI live alone, and everyday after work I find myself being a hermit, since I can't afford to go out. I don't have a single friend who I can call to grab a drink with, so I often drink alone at home. I do not drink during the week, and always have a glimmer of hope of doing something fun on the weekend...to no avail. Everyday now when I get home from work, I sit in silence and wonder why...why the fuck is this all happening. I lost my kids in a sense, I lost my fianc\u00e9e, I went from doing real estate with her full-time(she owns the real estate office we are with), to thankfully securing a full-time job with decent pay and good hours.  With the loss of her and I's relationship, came the lost of all the friends we would hang out with. Her friends had their boyfriends/husbands that I would hangout with, and I haven't heard a word from anyone since the split.\n\nMy physical health isn't 100% which takes a toll on me. I have arthritis in both knees, which makes doing a lot of what I love, very hard to do. I am receiving disability from the VA for this, since it first started up as an issue when I was active duty. Running, hiking, lifting weights, calisthenics...all things I would love to do, I almost can't. I am 6'2\" and about 280lbs, and I would love to get down to about 230, but with a thyroid issue and limited capabilities due to my knees, it seems I can only maintain a healthy diet and do mostly upper body, which can only do so much.\n\nAs I'm typing this, it doesn't seem to be the biggest issues, but I feel defeated and so alone in life, and ponder daily if it's worth it. My kids are the only reason I am here, but as of late, I begin to even wonder how affected they would be if I wasn't here.\n\nI'm crossing my fingers that things can improve, and I am doing my best to put effort into making things improve...but that all still doesn't help me not feel alone.\n\nI realize this may have gone off course, and I am not the best at explaining how I am feeling, but I did feel the need to at least get it off my chest.",

        "body": "I\u2019m not sure how to start this. I think I was drawn to this place because of the comfortable anonymity. So I think I can say it. I\u2019m a writer- I write poems and I have written stories in the past. I\u2019ve been inclined to it above everything else and I still feel like it\u2019s my most primitive and natural instinct to write. I keep diaries. I write everything in them. So naturally, if anyone read them\u2026well\u2026\n\nI\u2019m incessantly looking for something more. I have glimmers of fleeting moments etched into my mind and I have cultivated poems from them. I feel like I belong in these moments. I feel at home when I listen to songs and lyrics that evoke this emotion. I feel like I\u2019m meant to live. Live like no one has ever live. I have this persistent and compelling desire to find out what this all means. To live all these moments and discover the unknown. To be bathed in thrill and to feel voraciously. I know this is all verbose and complicated- but I couldn\u2019t possibly express the desperation and urgency I feel without\u2026this. And I\u2019m alone. I don\u2019t expect others to absorb what I say and just blurt out sweet nothings. I don\u2019t expect to be understood. I wish I was acknowledged and admired and listened to. But there\u2019s no such person. I have so much hope that I\u2019m yet to know all the people I will love- inspired by a post I saw on Pinterest \u201cYou haven\u2019t met all the people you will love\u201d. There\u2019s something so enigmatic about it- yet so, so relieving. \n\nBut these are thoughts. When it boils down to what is real- I\u2019m barely in it. My parents expect things from me. Society has drawn out rigid paths for compliance. I have a disdain for people who think that a person is simply a perception of them. And I feel that we are reduced to our perceptions all the time. You might be thinking that I posted under the wrong thread, this all makes more sense philosophically. But the truth is that I\u2019m in so much pain- and it\u2019s because of all this that I\u2019m suffering. I feel tormented when no one did anything in particular to hurt me. I feel pressured to conform and be reduced to my \u201cideal\u201d and \u201crational\u201d self. I\u2019m 16. I don\u2019t know anything about college or the world. I feel that I\u2019m being pigeon-holed into a path that promises success- but at what cost? Writing an essay to a university, how much of myself can I release? I certainly cannot attach my Reddit profile because then they would read this and find out who I actually am. So I\u2019m living a superficial lie. And then I realise that we\u2019re all living a superficial lie. I\u2019ve had countless revelations like these over a period of time and I believe they have all collated to create my depression. There\u2019s so much left unspoken. I haven\u2019t even begun to express how shattered I feel every single day. How desperate and devoid I am of love. But if no one knows, at least you do now. I\u2019ll surely write more, and i\u2019ll certainly vent here.\n\nThank you for reading this <3. ",

When i walked into a room i felt super anxious. I couldnt even order food at a restaurant.  But in the last 2 years i lost weight,improved my style hygiene etc. Improved my social skills. And i can and do actually talk to people now. My confidence is very high. But the problem is that nobody still cares about me. Nobody finds me interesting and takes me serious.Nobodys wants to be close with me. Even my old friends sold me out and dont talk to me anymore. I talk to people in school but as soon as the school day ends were just strangers again. Everyone has many real friends,they go out,have fun. Everyone has girlfriends/boyfriends.Theyre just your normal teenagers.When i hear people talking about these i feel so weird.But i,im just a fucking loser who only wakes up goes to school,comes home,studies and sleeps. My contact list is literally only my family. I never texted a girl.I fucking hate this shit. Summer is right around the corner and its gonna be even worse because i wont even go to school. I will literally not get out of my house for 3 whole months and not gonna see people. Everytime im just walking i think about how a miserable piece of shit i am and how my life will be in the future. This also busies my mind and makes my perfomance at school worse.If i was younger you would be like okay but my age is not a joke anymore. Next year im gonna be an adult. I need to fix this but i dont know how.I just want to be like other people.Because nobody cares about me i thought id write to here.",

It's not graphic, I assure you.\n\n--/\n\nSeven months ago, I tried to kill myself.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, I was relieved to be alive, but soon regressed back to suicidality.\n\nI then decided that I would fight to live on for the sake of those who cared for me, but with no intrinsic desire to remain alive.\n\nNow, finally, after all this time, I can say that I want to stay for this show -- for my own self.\n\nAnd suddenly, there's a whole bunch of things happening. I'm getting intrusive images which are both memories and visions of my death. I instinctively wince at these before I realise what has happened. My heartbeat goes supersonic and my face becomes as hot as a summer day. I even lose my balance sometimes.\n\nEmotionally, there's multiple issues:\n\n1. There was a significant duration in which I thought that I was going to die and that no amount of medical help could change that. Just experiencing that has changed me.\n\n2. Physiologically speaking, I don't know how I am alive. I'm not being dramatic here. I didn't gently approach the line between life and death and then back off. I ran full speed towards that line, too fast to stop. And yet, here I am.\n\n3. When I think of what would have happened after I had died, if I had died, my eyes must up. I feel guilty, utterly guilty, when I think of what mum, dad, sis, and friends would have had to go through if I had died. Including the discovery of the body, the last rites... And their grief. Their self blame. My throat's going all chokey as I type this.\n\n4. I'm terrified that my demons will return to finish what they started. There's nothing too substantial keeping the lid on them.\n\nSo, yeah. All this is swirling in my heart.\n\nI know I need a trauma therapist, but apart from that.... What do I do? How do I forgive myself? How do I stop seeing myself as being a bad person for what I've done?",

I\u2019m really scared I\u2019m gonna look back on my life and feel like I played it too safe. Does anyone else relate? \n",

        "body": "i take back my words bout not wanting to die anymore, it was never true. i cant take this shit no more, im so fcking weak and disgusting unwanted idiotic pain in ass, a major burden on this world and to my family. I wanna fall from somewhere, off a building, or a bridge, or a cliff, just somewhere, i dont like this feeling, i dont know what to do, i dont know what will i do. All i wanna do is quit everything and live in a distant village, away from these burdens, the things that remind me of my incompetence and how unwanted i am. I want to be all cut up, not just the same arm, same spot, stacking the scars. I also wanna cut other parts of my skin but when im sober, i dont want scars. At least i want to be able to completely cut this one arm if not other skins but im a coward, im always scared what if i regret them someday. I just wanna be covered in blood, bleed relentlessly, then again, im not a deep cutter either. Why tf do i have a family??? wtf do i care about them????? i mostly resist the urges cos i dont wanna be caught by any of them and draw a blank when asked. I dont wanna be looked down upon by any stupid fcks. I am looked down upon all day everyday, im below fckin average and it makes me wanna die. I am insecure about my appearance yes, but it doesnt make me hurt myself as much as my incompetence does. I dont have any value anywhere. Someone as incapable, as unworthy, as ugly, as stupid, as failing, as average as me was never supposed to be given this life. Im so miserable, please, i just wanna be cut up or do some physical damage to my body. Im too weak to be dealing with this shit. What tf do i do, i dont wanna be alive, im so fed up with myself my head hurts.\n\nEdit: an hour and more passed it seems. It was a mood swing and it passed. My bad for putting this shit here. I feel better now.",

Me wanting to die isn\u2019t because I feel worthless or hated, its more that I just want to exist in peace, of course hoping that if and when I do eventually die, wether its due to natural causes in like 75 years or not, that there\u2019s another place I\u2019ll go after this life where I have nothing to worry or stress about\n\nI would call myself severely addicted to my own awful mental habits, and I am aware that I need to break the cycle but I just either don\u2019t have it in me most of the time, or don\u2019t know how. It\u2019s been piling on me for years and its gotten to the point where it\u2019s boiled over a few times. Medication is something I\u2019d consider as a last resort thing, however it would only be hiding the underlying issues. Keeping myself occupied helps a lot but I feel that also just makes me walk away from my issues rather than deal with them. Basically what I\u2019m asking is if anyone has some advice on how to break the cycle(s). Also if anyone would like more info on this situation I would be happy to share, its just too much for me to type and would take me days to explain the full of it. ",

        "title": "Broken Self",
        "body": "What do you do when no one answers when you call? I (46F) have never really had a home or friends. No one to really care about me. As a baby, I was born slightly deformed. I didn't know I was until I was about 8yrs I guess. Maybe 13yrs, that was the age my mother told me and I have never looked in the mirror the same way since. By the time I was 9 months old, (I have a photo of me at that age) you can't tell that my face was crooked. I can though. I almost died twice as a baby. My father was cleaning his guns and my mother had laid me on the floor next to him. The gun fired missing me by about a foot from what my mother told me. The first time it was a break-over shotgun so I don't understand how he couldn't have known it was loaded. I think they were both drunk. I almost died as a toddler. My mother left me on the shore of a lake, I was about 3yrs, and she swam away from me. I had tried to reach her and almost drowned because no one was watching me. At about 7yrs, my father almost drowned me. He had grabbed my ankles and dragged me underwater about three feet into deep water. My aunt and uncle that was there was laughing at me as I crawled out of the water coughing up water. I remember my father telling me I was fine and to just get up and go back to swimming. I never went back in the water while with any of them around. If I did, the water had to be clear and I always needed to know where they were to me. A few times they tried to get my cousins to drag me in the water. They all stopped when I held one of them under the water and blooded the nose of another. At age 7yrs my mother and father were divorced. My mother had abandoned us to our father. She always had an excuse as to why we couldn't visit. The courts had given her my younger brothers (conceived during a separation while drinking) and me and the oldest boy to our father. But she just left all of us with him. In many ways, he was the better parent. We were always broke and mostly homeless. I say mostly homeless because we would live with my grandparents and aunt and uncle (my dad's sister) Later I learned that when we weren't living with them, it was because my father was fighting with my aunt and uncle. usually over money.At around 10yrs, we were back with my mom. Living with her sister and son. Then we were at my grandmother's (her mom) until they would be fighting over money. At 11yrs we finally had a home but our mother was once again tired of being a parent. She was able to send my brothers to live with our father again, but I refused to go and my step-mother told my father that she didn't want me with them. For years it went like this. my mother trying to trick me into living with my father and my stepmother fighting to keep me out. Whenever I was forced to live with them, she would move out. I was made to know that her leaving was my fault. At 13 or 14yrs, I had enough of that. Three knock down drag out fights finished that living situation. Back at my mother's but I was never home. I would go to school just to eat. I would go to friends' homes just to feel wanted but learned I wasn't by their parents. It would go on like that until I was 18yrs.That's when I would just be dating someone just to learn he didn't want me either. At 21, I married a man who told me he only married me because I looked like his true love (mother of his twins conceived after we married) At 18yrs, I had planned to end myself at 21, but I was pregnant. I had hoped my marriage would get better because we were having a son. Instead, he kicked us out when my son was 2 months and moved her in. We were homeless and so that I could work, I had to force my mother to watch her grandson. She only would if the weird neighbor wouldn't. My ex-husband refused to pay support and I couldn't get paid enough so I couldn't afford childcare. I was able to keep us in a home but barely kept the lights on. I spend years alone with my son. Every \"man\" I was interested in was not interested in me beyond a one-night stand. When my son was 7yrs, I met someone. I was so lonely, I didn't care about his past. But his past caused me to spiral. Lost our home. Lost my friends. So after finally giving him up, I moved us to my mother's to start over. Then I lost my son. He went into CPS and I was forced to spend so much time fighting for him with no help. No support. Having to beg \"family\" to at the very least take him in. I am alone living in the Salvation Army shelter. I met someone. He was alone too. I tried again. Had a daughter, while still fighting for my son. CPS kept telling him I was on drugs and didn't want to visit him. CPS would tell me that he didn't want to see me. Once I called the state capital CPS home of and forced a review of my case, my son was returned to me. But the child I got back wasn't my son. I got a young man that thought it was ok to steal from me. The TPS refused to educate him, so I had to send him to my brother's so he could go to school. Instead, he quit and started doing drugs. For 8 years, I have supported him, supported his then-girlfriend. Helped them get jobs and gave them a home. All that was asked of them was to watch his sister and clean up after themselves. My home turned into a dumpster and I had to force them out. She committed su\\*\\*ide  and my son was there when it happened. So I was back to supporting him. He would put me down. Make sure I knew I was worthless as a mother and blame me for HIS depression. Here it is 2024, my daughter will soon be 8yrs and my son is 24 and I am so depressed, so tired, so alone that I no longer want to wake up in the morning. I don't want my daughter to be the one that finds me. I don't want to leave her behind to a world she will never know love in. So I sit here crying. I woke up again and now I got to try and find some strength to care for her. I want to scream. I want to through things. I want my sadness to just die. just a few days ago I had asked the Goddess to bring into my life someone to help me. To be my support. Now, I am facing homelessness again. I am facing being unemployed again. I am facing my daughter going to CPS again. I have learned this lesson. I don't want to repeat this lesson again. I have failed at life. Not the lessons learned. I don't know what to do. I just don't wish to wake up in the morning again. I can't off myself because I don't want it to be my daughter to find me. I want to disappear alone but I can't leave her behind. I am too tired to go, but I am too sad to stay.",

Over the last month or so, I've had a lot of people tell me I looked \"skinny\" or ask if I've lost weight. I didn't even notice, but I figured if so many people had, I must have. A few days ago, I was at my cousins and decided to weigh myself to see how much weight I've lost... I've lost 30lbs in the last 3 months. It didn't start as a complete aversion to food, just not having an appetite. My moods tanked significantly in the last couple of weeks, and now I feel like I don't deserve to eat. I went to the ER after weighing myself to make sure there wasn't an underlying medical cause, but now that's all been ruled out, I've realized that I'm doing this to myself. My appetites gotten even worse, and I haven't eaten in 2 days, 3 if you don't count half a donut and a mandarin orange as food. I have access to food, and my boyfriend is trying so hard to get me to eat, but I can't. I don't want it, and just the thought of eating makes me nauseous to the point I almost puke. I have an appointment on Monday, but getting through the weekend feels like it's going to be an eternity. I need help, I hate myself and don't understand why I can't just eat. I'm just frustrated and tired...\n\nSorry if it doesn't make much sense, I'm pretty out of it.",

I worry I dont have enough friends, I feel jealous of people who go out every week and always seem to have someone to hang out with.  I constantly feel like i dont have enough friends and my relationships arent deep enough. Not to mention im terrified to rely on anyone and often find it hard to see why anyone would want to be my friend in the first place.\nI dont think i study enough, im not smart enough, im not fast enough, etc. its NEVER enough for me. \n\nI really dont like myself.

I think i was one of the only ones at my school who didn\u2019t have a single friend. How could there NOT be something wrong with me? Im convinced that my life will be forever cursed by loneliness and not belonging, and everything ive worked for will just fall apart anyway. \nI just want to get with of this dark cloud of shame that hangs over my head everyday.

I try to tell myself that my pain is real, but now I question if it even is. Am I really just a lazy person who wants attention or just wants it easy in life by saying I have this mental illness? Or is this real and not some sad excuse. I haven't been diagnosed of anything because my parents don't really know or particularly care about bringing me to a psychiatrist, they even use it as a threat whenever I feel very depressed. They mock this generation for \"having depression and committing suicide\". They are religious which doesn't help things. I'm too scared to tell them anything. \n\nHelp me understand if I'm just some sad attention seeker wanting an easier life or if this is actually real. \n",

        "body": "I have been in therapy and medications for 6 years now. It all started when I left a confusingly toxic home to become a writer. Before that I lived my whole life trying to get approval from my parents. Everything I did was just to make them happy, until I finally gave in and could gather enough courage leave home and still living, trying to get them to say that they are proud of me.\n\nI left home to become a writer, thought of getting a job on the side to pay my bills as I didn't have any support from family. After years of trying, I do get appreciation wherever I go, but earning hardly anything from it. And the job which was supposed to be a backup for my writing career, has become the main thing and writing is not even backup now.\n\nIn 26 years of my life, I have got abused physically by parents, raped on multiple occasions by a cousin, an uncle, got sexually abused by strangers on 2 different occasions. I started dating at the age of 15, coz I had to look for love outside, as I wasn't getting it at home. I gave love a chance, 5 times in my whole life. In first 2, I got cheated on, third one left coz her best friends thought I wasn't good for her, 4th one was all good at first but then things started getting very toxic. The person I was with, would lie and cheat, would call me randomly and say some cuss words and hang up, with me trying to figure out what just happened. Things went on to get so bad that just to get out of it, for the first time in my life, while being in a relationship, when someone who is not my girlfriend, tried to kiss me, I didn't stop her. When I realised what I just did, I couldn't live that. I would get the episodes of anxiety where I couldn't even breathe and would be rolling on the floor. I couldn't live with the disgust of what I had become.\n\nI tried to kill myself on multiple occasions. I didn't want to just hurt myself, I wanted this life to end. But don't know what it is with me and death that no matter how much accurately I would plan it, I won't die, somehow. I don't see any hope, any point of living this life anymore.\n\nWith the frustration in my last job, I even had to quit it.\n\nNow with hardly any money on me, any work on me, any family or friends or anyone by myside, I am sitting here in my apartment, with a half burnt cigarette, teared up eyes, almost choking, trying to figure out how to get another work and pay my rent next month, and for my therapy and for my medications.\n\nFunny thing is, the last piece of work I have written so far, was my suicide note.\n\nI don't know what to do from here.\n",

Out of commission for two plus months. \n- August, put myself into financial hardship to keep job since they wouldn\u2019t let me work remote or hybrid and they are a 45 minute drive away. Had to get a second vehicle I couldn\u2019t afford. \n- September, company reorganization. I get switched to a whole new job, team, and building. I know no one and I\u2019m not a social person. I struggle with the new position. \n- October, my mom dies. This one hurts a ton because she was always there for me and now I don\u2019t have anyone I trust to talk to. \n- November, get fired. Got told that I was missing deadlines and job functions that I was never informed about. \n- December, get a new job, it doesn\u2019t pay the bills. Start to get behind on everything. Can\u2019t afford a Christmas for me and my kids that I have split custody of. \n- January, mine and my moms birthday month. I start struggling with my age and how unaccomplished and worthless I feel. \n- February, have several promising interviews for better jobs. Got rejected from the one I thought I did the best at and have been ghosted on the others. Feeling pretty worthless. \n- March, one kid gets admitted to a behavioral health center with suicidal thoughts that I was unaware of. CPS starts an investigation into me on alleged abuse of a different kid which is completely bogus. Get served to go to a custody hearing next week. I have no information about what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m also several months behind on mortgage and other bills. Oh, and I got fired this week again because I can\u2019t concentrate on work. \n\nI\u2019ve always kicked the bad thoughts away because I\u2019ve never wanted to leave my kids. But now I might be losing them and I\u2019m spiraling. They are the last things that have been keeping me grounded to this life. \n\nI\u2019ve thought of whether I would give things away and to whom. I\u2019ve thought about what notes and mementos I would leave behind. I\u2019ve thought of how I would do it. I\u2019m scared because anytime I\u2019ve had those thoughts, I\u2019ve dismissed them immediately. But now, there\u2019s a maybe to them all. I pulled up the website on my phone to call the other day because the thoughts got intense on my drive home. \n\nI\u2019m so tired. I\u2019m tired of failing. I\u2019m tired of being not good enough. The one thing I thought I had was being a good dad and that\u2019s getting taken away. I\u2019m tired of wasting everyone\u2019s time and thoughts. ",

We used to be relatively close when we were younger. However, as time went by, I was a lot more focused on school and friends so we talked a lot less. When quarantine happened, I isolated myself and was just watching shows and studying on my own so I hardly even saw her or spoke with her and wherever we did it was always an argument. It's been 4 years now since we had an honest heart-to-heart. And in these 4 years, she has grown up to be someone I detested. She would swear at my mother and sometimes act physically with her, she would also swear at my stepdad when all they both did was concern themselves with her well-being, appearance, education, and relationship with god . She would speak to my mother with such attitude and sarcasm which would make me dislike her even more. She steals their money. She even ran away from home once, and my mother and uncle had to chase after her. My stepdad has an issue with his feet and is due to have surgery later this year, and my mother has extremely varicose veins. so you can imagine how distraught I was to find her laughing about their failed attempt at chasing after her. It reached a point where I thought I was at fault since I am the older sister, and maybe she was acting out because I don't talk to her anymore. So I said sorry for the way I've treated her. She said sorry too and we both cried. A day later, I talked to her about her actions and how disrespectful it is, but nothing changed. Funnily enough, she swears at my mother at some point in the day, every day, and still acts the same way with attitude religion, etc, even with me now she steals my clothes, not returning them, my makeup, my food, and lies about it and is also rude to me as well and shows no emotion when I speak to her kindly as though I am speaking to the dead. I want to cut her off completely now but want to make sure I'm justified in doing that. I want to also say my mom works hard 4 jobs every day my uncle doesnt work due to his leg and so it hurts to see my mom lose her money because of a thieving daughter.",

        "body": "I just need to rant for a bit before my mind fucking explodes. I\u2019m 22 and I\u2019ve been depressed since about 12. I thought it was \u201cjust a phase \u201c like everyone kept telling me it was. And year after year I kept believing it. I always thought life would get better. And there are pockets of time where I feel like I\u2019ve finally beaten depression and can move on. But I quickly find myself in the same vicious cycle of depression and disassociation. I had a drunken father for the early years of my life and both my parents would beat me for just being a kid. They have made a complete flip now but the damage they have caused lives with me forever. \n\nI\u2019ve been in a lot of relationships over the years, many of them not lasting a couple months. Mainly because I would rather push people away than let them get close and hurt me and break me more than I already am. I eventually found someone who didn\u2019t run or give up when I pushed her away. We have been married for a couple years and have a couple of kids. And I thought it would make me happy and change me. I have learned a lot and have shared a ton of unforgettable memories together with my family. But throughout our marriage the cycle persisted. I\u2019m to the point where getting out of bed is so hard. Showering, eating, going out, it\u2019s such a chore. And more days than not I feel numb, I don\u2019t feel anything when looking at my wife\u2019s and kids. I feel a shit ton of guilt because of it. \n\nI\u2019ve gone to therapy earlier in life and they didn\u2019t help. I\u2019ve attempted to book appointments an always answer truthful on the mental health questionnaires when going to the clinic for check ups and stuff. But no one gets back to me, no one seems to give a fuck. I do things now to cope that I am not proud of. But yeah, I just wanted to rant. I\u2019m depressed, I\u2019m tired, and I hope that tomorrow isn\u2019t the day I blast my brains out. \n\nStay safe everyone, I\u2019m proud of you and you are loved.",

        "body": "Sorry this is long. I started writing, and couldn\u2019t seem to stop. If you read one sentence, thank you for listening. Any support or advice would be appreciated. \n\n\u2022\n\nTold my family I\u2019m depressed and wake up feeling like I\u2019ve run a marathon despite getting 10 hours of sleep. \n\nThem: Wow, that\u2019s weird. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re overreacting. You should talk to a doctor about that. \n\nTold my family the doctor made worried faces and kept re-doing my vital checks. That I\u2019ve fainted 6 times in 2 years without my body giving a warning. Told them about the time I almost died one time, woke up with my eyes bruised, nose bloody from my unconscious body smashing my face into the floor from spasms, gasping for breath. That I know somethings wrong, and I\u2019m genuinely scared of being alone. \n\nThem: Wow that\u2019s strange. You should see a doctor about that. It\u2019s up to you to take the 2 hour trek into town though, good luck, try not to pass out on the way there I guess. Anyway I\u2019m going to spend the next 15 minutes talking about my island vacation and act like you didn\u2019t say anything. By the way feel free to reach out anytime I\u2019m happy to help. \n\nTold my family I need help. That getting up, making food and drinking water is getting to be impossible some days. That I feel so empty, unmotivated and alone every day. Rent and food princes keep going up, and the realization I\u2019ll never have a home or family of my own is affecting me. I want a future but don\u2019t see one. That just talking with them helps. That I need guidance and advice, I can\u2019t do this alone. That my therapist told me to talk to my family, because going back to a psych ward would make everything so much worse. I crave connection so bad I dream about it. That I do want help and to get better, but with every step in the right direction I make, I keep getting pushed back 3. I still want to keep trying, but am overwhelmed with memories, debt, and unending news about the world getting more impossible to live in. Climate change and pandemics currently affecting the reality I\u2019m in, but I\u2019m told talking about it will be weird, and break normalcy. \n\nThem: Wow, that\u2019s a lot. You\u2019re kind of bumming me out, and I don\u2019t want to sit with an uncomfortable feeling long enough to even pretend faking empathy. That anything other than puppies and kittens, I don\u2019t want to talk about. That my voice is going to remain cold and distracted through this conversation so you can tell I think you\u2019re crazy. There\u2019s nothing the doctors will find through the tests to explain your symptoms. There\u2019s nothing wrong with your heart, you\u2019re just overthinking. You don\u2019t need a diagnosis, just need to try harder. You should talk to a therapist about this. Even though you can\u2019t afford one anymore after your job laid you off. Which was all your fault by the way. Sucks for you I guess. Anyway have I told you about this party I went to- \n\nTold my family I got 3 letters from the hospital booking me for cardiology appointments. I still don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with my body. I feel like my past is catching up to me. I\u2019ve taken responsibility on my choices and actions, know where I messed up, and where I just needed more support. I\u2019ve struggled with procrastination and anxiety which affected my work and studies. I wasn\u2019t able to finish post-secondary school, and got fired. I\u2019m trying to change, and want to make better choices. But the days keep slipping by faster than I can keep up. I want to grow and be gentler, but keep getting panic attacks that seems to leech hours from the day. I keep falling asleep randomly and stay asleep for too long. That even when I\u2019m awake, everything feels so dark and heavy. Like I\u2019m constantly pulling 10,000 pounds on my back and can\u2019t drop it. That even though I\u2019m sober, I feel like I\u2019m walking in a dream, everything\u2019s fuzzy and snapping out of it takes up all the little energy I do have. I keep getting angry at myself for not having enough energy, too much anxiety. How it feels like my mind is torturing my body. How every therapy technique I\u2019ve been given doesn\u2019t stop it. I\u2019ve been to over 3 dozen councillors, therapists and psychologists, majority telling me I\u2019m beyond what they are capable of treating. I\u2019ve listened to countless podcasts and books about tips and tricks, grounding techniques and naming every emotion I feel. Nothing helps. That my mind consumes me with extreme guilt and rage over small accidents like dropping a glass. I keep screaming at myself alone in my apartment because I\u2019m so frustrated I can\u2019t bring myself to get up. That I know I\u2019m self-destructing, but don\u2019t know how to stop spiralling. That I don\u2019t want to burden them with my mind, but if they would talk to me like a human, maybe I\u2019ll start feeling like one. If they could just call me every once in a while, let me know I\u2019m not as alone as I know I am. That maybe if they see physical reasons I\u2019m suffering, instead of mental, they\u2019ll possibly take me seriously. If they saw a broken heart instead of a broken mind, they might care. To listen to what I\u2019m saying instead of making assumptions or opinions. I\u2019m not blaming them or even myself anymore for the past, I just want to get better and live. That I\u2019m being honest, because that\u2019s what they said I should do. But when I\u2019m honest about being suicidal, they look at me like I\u2019m a monster. Begging them to just tell me to keep trying. \n\nThem: This is your fault, and because of only your choices. Why are you telling me about your medical issues. You\u2019re being ungrateful for the past help we\u2019ve given. There is something wrong with you, but it\u2019s your soul and sins. I\u2019m going forget the actions of the people from this family who gave you panic attacks by chasing you through the house screaming at you to be normal after you wore blue lipstick to school once. That we said we didn\u2019t believe you. That we said being gay isn\u2019t something this family agrees with. That you should forgive the beatings your father gave you. You should ignore him saying in front of your sister, that he doesn\u2019t love you, and no one likes you. That your sister agreed. It was your fault CPS made him feel temporary shame, but then believed him when he said he never hurt you. Ignore the trauma your mothers violent death at her own hands gave you. That even though you remember at 10 years old telling her to stop being distracted driving, she kept doing it. Why can\u2019t you get your drivers license. Why can\u2019t you get a job. Why can\u2019t you just eat. Why can\u2019t you just be normal and just stop thinking. You\u2019re obviously not trying hard enough. Now, if you\u2019re done complaining, I\u2019m not going to talk to you for the next 6 months, and \u201cpray\u201d you\u2019ll find the light. \n\nMe: I\u2019m sorry for bothering you ",

        "body": "I\u2019ve been struggling with moderate depression and anxiety throughout my entire life and pretty much learned how to live with it. Ironically living with these conditions wasn\u2019t  the part I became the most skilled at. Hiding how I was actually feeling every day was my super power.\n\n Let\u2019s face it no one wants to be around a person that is constantly in a bad headspace and doesn\u2019t want to leave the house due to overwhelming anxiety. The result was as you\u2019d expect I was the kid that always had a smile on his face and pretended like  I wasn\u2019t suffering of crippling anxiety and depression just so I could fit in. \n\nThis strategy worked pretty good and even though I was suffering every day I managed to sustain a \u201cnormal life\u201d.  At some point you no longer feel like you\u2019re suffering because you\u2019re kind of normalizing the emotional and physical pain accompanied by these mental health conditions. But obviously I reached my limit at some point. I quite literally imploded both mentally and physically. \n\nIt started with slightly heightened anxiety which then got worse and worse until I was so anxious I couldn\u2019t get out of bed because I would literally pass out.  My resting heart rate would average around 120 bpm, and I experienced shortness of breath all day. Couldn\u2019t eat, couldn\u2019t sleep, couldn\u2019t concentrate. \n\nThen I also unlocked a new range of symptoms. Derealisation and  depersonalisation scared the living shit out of me. It got so bad that at some point it felt like I woke up in a complete nightmare. About 90% of my memories were gone and I had this weird out of body feeling 24/7. \n\nI\u2019ve been struggling with suicidal ideation before but due to the exacerbated anxiety and depression this time the emotional and physical pain became so unbearable that I started planning to end my life. \n\nLuckily my attempt was pretty half assed mainly because I didn\u2019t had the mental energy to think it through properly. \n\nI got admitted to a psychiatric hospital and I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder. The psychiatrist put me on both sertraline (SSRI) and bupropion (SNDRI) and I started seeing a therapist. \n\nMoral of the story: don\u2019t think you can overcome these cruel mental health conditions by yourself. I kept al my problems to myself because I was ashamed of them. \n\nI literally had so many reasons not to feel the way I felt. I have a loving family that support me in any way possible, have lovely friends that make me feel comfortable with being myself, never ever struggled financially, although I wouldn\u2019t describe myself as good looking I have been told that I have decent looks, and psychological  tests revealed that my IQ scores around 125. I bet some people would pay a lot of money to posses al these things but I felt insanely numb about them which caused a ton of guilt and low self esteem \n\nLater on my psychiatrist explained that depression often isn\u2019t caused by your life conditions but rather influenced by your perspective on these conditions. \n\nHaving depression or anxiety is NOT your fault.  Yes some lucky people in this world may barely or never struggle with them whilst you can\u2019t live a normal life. \n\nLife is not fair. I know that sounds extremely pessimistic but once you start accepting  it you find yourself comparing your life to other people\u2019s lives less often. \n\nFor those of you reading this who are also thinking about ending their lives. Please hear me out. \n\nI won\u2019t give you some glamourised speech about why life is worth living. Because if you\u2019re actively thinking about suicide you\u2019re going through pain so extreme that I\u2019ll probably never ever find the words to comprehend your suffering. \n\nThat said only the fact that you\u2019re reading these words and are still breathing proves incomprehensible courage and mental strength. \n\nEven though suicide crossed your mind numerous times you\u2019re still here. I can imagine you might not believe this but the fact you\u2019re still here is because there is still something in you that wants to live. \n\nEvery time suicide crosses your mind and you dismiss the thought is proof that deep inside you there is something that wants to live and more importantly believes there is still hope. \n\nSending lots of love and hugs to all of you suffering \u2764\ufe0f \n\n\n\n",

Because of this, I haven't been taking care of myself well, especially when it comes to my physical health, like dental care.\n\nGrowing up, I wasn't great at brushing my teeth and flossing regularly. Even though I knew it was important, I often skipped it, especially when I became more independent. It's not that I didn't know how to do it or wasn\u2019t taught how; it's just that the feeling and sensation of brushing my teeth felt uncomfortable, so I avoided it when I could which became more and more frequent as i aged. \n\nWhen I got braces at 12, things got worse. Some parts of my teeth were covered, and I couldn't clean them properly even when i did feel up to brushing. I ended up with cavities under my braces, so they had to take them off way too early, and I lost track of my retainer, so my teeth shifted back after the braces were removed. I feel terrible because my parents spent a lot of money on my braces, and I didn't take care of my teeth properly. I have a stage 3 overbite which has always caused me extreme issues in my self esteem and having a habit where i put things in front of my mouth when i\u2019m talking, without even noticing i\u2019m doing so. I\u2019d have to spend another 5 grand on braces to get rid of the overbite. \n\nNow, my teeth are yellow, I have several cavities, and two of my teeth are broken, falling apart into pieces. I'm scared to go to the dentist because I'm ashamed of letting it get this bad. I'm worried that even if I go and get the cavities fixed, my teeth will still look disgusting and I'll have spent hundreds on fillings to still have extreme self esteem issues. \n\nI feel like I've ruined my teeth in the first 20 years of my life, and I'm angry at myself for it. This is a big factor in my depression as ironic as it sounds. I don\u2019t wanna go out and have fun because i\u2019ll laugh and smile and then it\u2019s just all on display. \nI'm afraid I'll never have nice teeth without spending thousands on procedures like veneers or expensive whitening treatments, and I'll always have gaps in my teeth from breaks and them being shaven down due to cavities\n\nAm I stuck with these unhealthy, discolored, and gapped teeth forever?",

I\u2019m sorry for my ramblings but I really only started to notice these changes as of late. I think this coupled with getting off meds that might have been inconsistent (liquid Zoloft mixed in with orange juice to now pill form) but I don\u2019t know what caused a shift. I just stopped trying to make excuses for it and actually tried to own up to it and help myself (not that I hadn\u2019t before, I was just very gloomy and tense, causing me to be disappointed in everything and making me miserable) I also realized I was bisexual after trying to repress same sex attraction. I don\u2019t know exactly what happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nagain, I\u2019m very sorry for my incoherent rambling, I am extremely tired and I never use reddit. ",

So I\u2019m pretty against medication, I have anxiety around side effects and not feeling natural and comfortable in my body (I don\u2019t drink or even take pain killers or anything because I don\u2019t like not having control over my mind/body). I\u2019ve recently been diagnosed with a brain condition and depression. My brain meds have been fucking amazing and I\u2019m a bit more open to the idea of trying out medications in general now. \n\nThe only other medication I\u2019ve ever taken really was Lexapro a few years back, the smallest dose (due to my anxiety) and it made no effect whatsoever, positive or negative, couldn\u2019t even tell I was taking it. \n\nMy doctor is super supportive of my look and anxiety around medications and is happy for me to get a gauge on what I\u2019m comfortable trying and then getting her approval on it. I\u2019ve been looking into bupropion for several reasons, it seems perfect. \n\nI\u2019m a smoker who moved over to vaping. I\u2019m not actively looking for or trying to quit, but if it happens that\u2019s neat. I can\u2019t risk weight gain and I\u2019m obese due to another medical condition (hormonal) and my obesity caused my brain condition, I quite seriously need to loose weight, if anything. That was my main drive in looking for an antidepressant, as I know a lot cause weight gain. I have excessive fatigue and oversleep due to my depression, 18 hours a day at least. I have no motivation or energy whatsoever and spend my entire life in bed. They are my main and major struggles with my depression, I\u2019m not sad or suicidal, just incredibly tired and devoid of all interests or emotions. I also not a lot of antidepressants make you tired which is the last thing I need. That\u2019s what\u2019s leading me to bupropion. \n\nBut I\u2019d love to find out, especially as no one I know has any experience with it, how it worked for you guys? Depression, energy, weight loss, any and all of it. Thank you!\n",

I don't really think there's much out there for me and I don't really even want to work towards making my life better for myself or improving myself as a human being. Only unfortunate part of my slow spiral is that it sometimes affects other people. I have little sense of self preservation, I have no self worth, and self-destruction is probably my best skill. I don't want kids, I don't really have a desire ro get married, probably won't go to school for a higher education, and I live in my own head daydreaming. I don't make goals or plans because I know I'll give up before I even start. To say that I'll be feel of regrets when I get old is valid, I am already full of regrets now. I feel like I might as well just keep racking them up. Even though I am apparently in control of my life, I feel like that's only a half truth, and to the other half that I believe, I choose to not take control of it. Does it make me bitter? Sure, but not towards other people. Only myself. I believe anybody can practically do anything, unless they're me. I feel like I have this weird backwards ego where I think I'm below everybody no matter what. I don't think any decision I make is ever a right one and I end up regretting everything I do even if it's the \"right\" thing to do. I don't want help anymore, I don't want pity, but what I do want is unattainable, but I have no real desire to improve either. So, I hide how I feel deep down and just carry on, I guess. But sometimes that all you can do, right? I want to live, deep down, not just exist. But then I ask myself if any of it is even worth it. I was nothing, I am nothing, and I'll probably continue to be nothing. I don't trust myself with my own happiness or life, but no one should have to make my decisions for me. I have to take life by the horns, but I'd rather let it run me down. I don't want to fight anymore. It's not worth it to me anymore. I have no right to complain though, since I choose not to fix my problems, but it's nice to vent every so often. I've always heard \"You can either say 'One Day' or 'Day One'.\" At this point, I'd rather take my chances with 'One Day', living in the delusion of \"It's gets better\", when in reality, it only gets better if you work for it.

        "body": "I don't think anyone will want to read this, but I have an issue with cutting people off and I'm just trying to understand the advice a lot of people give that you should cut people off.\n\nI'm gonna give 2 examples of people I've cut off. First is someone I think everyone here would agree I made the right decision on.\n\nSo basically my best friend from high school. Eventually he found some other friends and became involved in some criminal activity. So I went from hanging out with him all the time to when he introduced me to his criminal friends, and then I felt the expectation that I also have to get involved in this criminal activity to hang with them. I wasnt going to do that and I wasnt going to accept being downgraded by my best friend so I cut him off.\n\nWas I wrong for that? I really don't think so tbh.\n\nAlso it was serious criminality, not just smoking weed etc, which I was doing. it's shit they literally got arrested and charged for pretty recently.\n\nBut here's the second instance. Total opposite type of person. Super smart, super professional, and also one of my best friends. But basically what happened is I used to help him with his personal problems, as friends (supposedly) do. And he had quite a few, mostly relationship issues. But I never opened up to him about my personal issues because of my own insecurities, which I know is wrong. But one day we were both opening up and I did open up about my issues, and...I got ignored, basically. Dude basically said \"that sucks bro but...\"\n\nSo I cut him off.\n\nI already know most of you will say I'm right about the first guy, but I truly feel equally as strongly about the second guy. And yes I got a fake \"I'm sorry if I made you feel...\" apology from him. That cemented my decision to cut him off. Am I wrong? Am I sabotaging myself and my relationships?\n",

Most kids daily talk about topics that are stupid, it's coming to the point where the children around me have matured to quickly.. I mean look at this point we got 11yos making jokes about mass tragedies, like racist jokes, or jokes about the twin towers, I get dark humor, but hide it from children... also not just dark jokes, it's also a bunch of adultery, like for example, in my school, cuss words have become normalized, so had uh.. \"weird\" jokes, my fellow students also do this joke around, where the hump the tables.. That is disgusting, also the word gyatt, is always used on my young female teacher.. it's mad weird.. I believe the cause for this huge change was due to kids having too much free time during the pandemic.. This change makes me feel sad.\n\nHow do I deal with it?\nWell.. I try my best to fit in, as if I find these jokes funny, yet once I arrive home, I feel terrible...\n\nA bit personal..\nMy family isn't the best either.. my father the other day got into a fight with me, I felt super bad on that day, and I texted my mom about, my dad tracks this, and out of nowhere, I get thrown on the ground and my shirt gets ripped. My brother's alright.. thought he is VERY VERY judgmental.. same with my sister.\n\nAddiction \nI got an Addiction with those videos... It feels terrible.. the urge to watch those is going away but what I did in the past was crazy.. I did it for 5 times a day sometimes.. I don't even know how.. but I regret it.\n\n\nSummary for people who are lazy like me: \n1. Generation has changed a lot, and it impacts the way I feel, trying to fit in...\n\n2. Well.. I deal with this by going along with this terrible jokes\n\n3. Family is crazy.. dad has OCD, I'm starting to get it, plus anger issues\n\n4. I got a Addiction with those videos.. though it's going away..\n\nI'll get over it..",

I (F 33) don\u2019t even know what account this is coming from. \n\nI am medicated, completed two rounds of TMS, in an intensive outpatient program and none of it is doing much of anything. About 5 years ago I started to feel a slip in my \u201clust for life.\u201d It was gradual but persistent. I pushed through a demanding job while also getting my mba at night. Committing beyond my limits is a common occurrence in my past life. \n\nThen I just stopped. More like abruptly halted. While it felt like it came out of nowhere, it\u2019s been biding its time in the shadows. The intrusive thoughts, the constant internal shaming and insulting, the lack of effort to try and be healthy. For a while I could keep this exile at bay with alcohol or weed, until it overpowered them. \n\nI had career momentum, supportive family, spouse, etc. logically I tried to understand my depression, not that it\u2019s possible to be understood. Depression doesn\u2019t seem to be the right word for it. It\u2019s a void. I can\u2019t look away now. I stopped working. I started sleeping all the time. An anxious part of me fought to get help and try to find a path back to something. Anything really. I am fighting what feels like a losing battle. \n\nI cry constantly, mostly unprovoked. I\u2019m stuck in the same rut over and over. When I look at my life I can\u2019t shake how absurd this all is. How wasteful I feel in not being able to look away from the void.

        "body": "I'm really struggling right now.\n\nI was working for a legal aid organisation in my state (I'm in Australia, for context). I have PTSD and I told them that before I started. I had been having some issues at work because most of the work that was done was either dealing with domestic violence, sexual offences, or child abuse. It was pretty triggering. My manager at the time asked for permission to send a letter to my psychiatrist asking what modifications need to be made to help me to do my job. That's how it was pitched to me anyway. So I gave permission.\n\nMy manager sent a 4 page letter to my psychiatrist detailing all of the issues with my performance. They said I was inappropriate and rude with clients and stakeholders, and that I was unable to receive feedback, plus other stuff. I disagreed with their assertions, but I went through the process. They asked for further information in January, and my psychiatrist responded. Due to her response, my employment was terminated. They originally told me that it was proposed, but they only gave me a week to respond, which wasn't enough time to get another medical opinion, or legal advice, or even advice from the union. So I had to respond without the benefit of assistance. They refused my counter proposal out of hand, saying that my suggestions were too onerous or unreasonable (I asked for a secondment to a team that doesn't deal with the aforementioned material) and terminated my employment effective immediately. They are allowed to discriminate against me like this because my psychiatrist said I'm unable to fulfill the requirements of the role. So there's no avenue for appealing their decision, or going down the unfair dismissal route (I'm a law student, I read relevant cases while I was waiting for the union to get back to me).\n\nI had also requested to not be on reception more than once per week because people would regularly call wanting legal advice about sexual assault, or trauma dumping about the abuse they suffered and it was upsetting for me. I didn't realise I was painting myself into a corner because work had made decisions to not allow me to undertake any other tasks in my role description except reception because they decided it would be triggering to me without consulting me or even communicating that they had made that decision.\n\nWhile this was going on, I got my bloodwork updated. it turns out that I am so severely anemic that the HbA1c test they tried to do failed because I didn't have enough hemoglobin available for the test. This probably explains why I've been feeling so exhausted. I've been sleeping a lot. Even though it's been 3 weeks since this all went down, I don't have any appetite and when I do eat, it's not a lot. Oftentimes by the time I get to the end of the day, I'm exhausted and don't have the energy to feed myself. \n\nI'm waiting for unemployment benefits, which will be another 3 weeks at least. I'm applying for other work, but I've not found anything yet. I'm feeling like I'm losing hope and I am just experiencing periods of being completely beside myself and not able to stop crying or do anything. So I spend most of time trying to keep myself busy, I spend most of my spare time playing video games, which is a helpful distraction.\n\nI'm basically just hoping that I'll find another job and feeling very scared about what's going to happen if I can't find anything. I'm trying to avoid thinking about the future too much because I can't actually cope with the idea of being unemployed. I also have an eating disorder, and not eating is exacerbating that as well, unfortunately.\n\nI don't know how to avoid spiraling. Does any one have any advice?",

        "body": "Sorry for the grammar and bad format just needed to vent my bad day out. For some context I've been struggling with depression for a while now, mostly about how i view myself. I've been trying to deal with my insecurities and i thought i was doing good for awhile but i just feel like now ive reached my lowest over just a small bad day I had yesterday and i cant pull out.\n\n I'll admit Ive been pretty stressed out as well the last few years and not sure if that is the main cause of the state of my hair. It has thinned out so much over the last few years  that when I part it, it has like an inch of scalp showing and pulling strands to the side reveals my scalp a lot. When I pull it into a ponytail it's about as thick as a nickel and i cant really even style it that much or style my bangs due to how much its thinned out. It's one of my greatest insecurities along with my weight. \n\nI've put on quite a bit of weight ever since I had my son but that was 5 years ago and I never have been able to consistently lose it. My depression hasn't been helping and while my partner has said that it doesn't bother them or that they find me attractive, comments like I'm boring or \"like a mom trying to relate to a teenager\" when i talk,  has me sort of spiral out and takes me a long time to get over it than it naturally should. I get stuck in this feeling of feeling old and fat and this ugly old mom when I'm only 24.\n\nI thought I was getting a better handle over these intrusive feelings and insecurities. I got new bangs and felt a bit better about myself and even put on makeup yesterday and styled my hair that I haven't done in a long time.\nThat same day my partner and I went on a  picnic date but it ended up leading to an argument on the way home. I decided to get some space and headed back out to the park to just go lie on a blanket in the sun and just relax. I found a very secluded spot towards the end of the park with no one around except a group of teenagers hanging out in a gazebo maybe 60 feet away. I started hearing them laughing and talking very loudly poking fun at eachother at first before I started hearing them talk about the \"the big lady in blue\" and making comments about my weight and then just whispering and laughing with eachother.\n\n I was trying my best to ignore them and just get back to lying down and relaxing and closed my eyes before I heard running steps towards me and opened my eyes just to see one of the boys had leaped over me missing my face by a good few inches before laughing and saying that they just wanted to make sure I wasn't dead. I'm not gonna lie and say I handled it well and im not very proud of it but I called the boy an asshole before just getting in the car and heading home in tears. I don't know what I was expecting I guess some comfort when I got home but my partner was still stressed from our argument and struggles with their bpd and didn't take it very well.  When asked what happened I told them of my run in with the teenagers and they proceeded to get upset over what happened and in their words were trying to help me.  By telling me that I can't stress out over this and then started looking at my head and telling me how bad my bald spot has gotten and that I've let myself go. This had me crying even more and my partner got more stressed and told me, \"I'm just trying to be honest what do you want me to say, that you're beau...\" before stopping.\n\nI'm aware that it's up to you to make sure you keep yourself in shape and that it's not fair to your partner especially since attractionis a major factor for relationships. But I guess I always convinced myself that it was fine because my partner said that my weight never bothered them and that I was fine the way that I am. I feel like the biggest lover and I'm stuck in this loop of resenting what I've allowed myself to become and feeling ugly and unattractive and just being disgusted with myself and then realizing I'm stressing myself out even more and making my balding hair even worse. I think I'm more grossed out of how sensitive I am and let myself just keep eating like shit for years and this whole time fooled myself thinking my partner thought I was attractive or okay with how much I let myself go. I know I got to get over it and start working on my mental and physical health but right now I feel like I can't move and just hate the person I am and can't get overwhelmed by everything that's wrong with me. I'm disgusted of the image of me putting food into my mouth so I'm glad atleast I'm not turning to food at the moment. Sorry for the crazy rant but it's more healthier venting this out on the internet then unloading this onto people I know.",

I'm not a good masturbator, and I can only feel some kind of arousal if I imagine myself as a girl. I thought it was just a fetish, but by the time I was 18 I was thinking about it literally several times a day.\n\nRecently, the feeling of anxiety has increased greatly, I often have panic attacks, I get very irritated sometimes, I often hurt myself (hitting my head against the wall, biting and cutting my hands). I turned to a doctor for help, after 4 months I received medication. They helped for a while, but they quietly increased my feelings of dysphoria, somehow unbeknownst to me, I began to explore the possibility of becoming trans, looked at other people, and this awakened certain feelings in me. Now it has become difficult for me to think about anything else, I began to sleep poorly (4 hours a day), eat poorly (lost weight from 83 kg to 73 kg), and yesterday I had my first major panic attack after taking medication. I couldn\u2019t stand it, I called the doctor, they admitted me, and there I told him with great difficulty (in fact, I wrote and showed the text, because it was very hard for me to talk about it) about my desires. The doctor prescribed therapy.\n\nNevertheless, it was hard for me, I have no friends, good acquaintances, and I only communicate with my parents. I decided to ease my mind a little (without mentioning the last visit to the doctor), talked about therapy and my feelings of anxiety, said that if they knew the truth about me, they would disown me. They thought I was gay and asked if I felt attracted to women, well, yes, I do, just not in the way they thought. After that, they said that all the problems were due to the fact that I didn\u2019t have sex, and after sex I would relax and stop worrying.\n\nThey promised to find me a girl, and I felt like complete crap because I couldn't tell them the whole truth. Sometimes I regret so much that I was born at all, lately I dream of falling asleep and never waking up (I'm too cowardly to kill myself, if I had the courage, I would have done it long ago, it would have only saved everyone people from my problems, anyway my life doesn\u2019t have much meaning, no one will worry if I die, especially if I write in a note about my feelings, everyone will even be happy). \n\nThey also asked to share with them their next visit to the therapist. So I decided that I would tell the therapist that my thoughts were just delusions, a momentary clouding, and I would feel better and would refuse therapy. It was very hypocritical to think that I could find happiness through therapy, but this happiness is impossible without the happiness of my parents. So I decided to just suppress all these feelings. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m writing this, I just need to express myself somewhere.\n",

It got to the moment where I cannot tell if I am being heard. So I assume that no one was hearing or listening to me.   \nThe moment I don't talk, the moment it becomes a problem. People start to worry. They would say things like why are you so quiet? Could it be that no one hears me out when I talk? That's what makes me depressed right now.",

They asked me to defend my case on why they should trust me and I stated that I don't currently have a best friend. I have a lot of close friends just not a 'best' friend.\n\nI didn't see it as sad in any way, but one of the other guys in the gc were like \"been there\" and that he understood how i felt. THEN the main guy texted me asking me how I was and wasn't taking 'good' for an answer. He then outed me as the therapist friend (which i didnt even realize i was) and then went on how I mattered too or wtv. At first he gave me a quote and when I said \"it sounds suicidal, but i like the metaphor' he then asked me if i was.   \nI'm not for clarification, but I have gotten thoughts like that.\n\nHe then proceeds to be my therapist, when I tried to ask him how he was he wouldn't answer and only questioned me on a lot of matters. Bro got a lot of info out of me. \n\nAnyway, I kept getting side tracked, but he would be like 'anyway' and the continue on.\n\nI didn't mind it one bit. I cried twice texting him. He got sm info out of me mannn. \n\nI told him about my 'mommy issues' which before I didn't realize until I started talking about it and realized that 'mommy issues' isnt having your mom run away, or physical abuse, and it isn't always black and white with the term 'mommy issues'. Later I'll deny my issues but I know right now what's good for me.\n\nI told him I felt recognized and that he made me cry twice happily.   \nHe told me that when I was talking about a previous best friend of mine I sounded lonely and sad about it, and that my story was really saddening. \n\nI feel bad about that, like maybe I overshared? I don't really know exactly how much of my life someone can take because I thought this was everyone. Is it not? \n\nI used to think he was annoying but the more I know him the more I see past him.

I\u2019m extremely grateful for all of this and I know that a lot of teens have it way worse but I just can\u2019t be in the same room as her sometimes. I\u2019m very easy to upset, very sensitive and like most people I do like it when things go my way. I know it\u2019s normal for a teenage girl to argue with their moms but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t an issue right? \nMy mom makes most things about her. I know that she had a tough childhood but I don\u2019t see why she should continue the cycle. She refuses to speak when I\u2019m not looking at her, she will legit get pissed when my family are having a conversation (a normal one that she can join in at any time) because no one is giving her attention, gets angry when one of us cuts her off but will do the same thing and see nothing wrong with it, she gets angry that \u201cno one\u201d helps her but will continue to complain even after someone did, will criticize what I like doing but will become extremely defensive if I call her out on it, she gets mad at the flick of a finger. One moment she\u2019ll be calm and before you know it, she\u2019s screaming the house down. I can\u2019t get a single word out or defend myself because in her eyes I am ALWAYS in the wrong. There is no \u201cwinning\u201d with her. She\u2019ll do anything to make you feel bad, she\u2019ll call herself a terrible mother and tell us how she feels like leaving and never coming back. She\u2019ll tell us how she\u2019s a slave in this house (literally for taking care of us like a mother should) and call us names. She\u2019s called us retards, she hit me on the head (I was pissed and trying to sleep and my siblings were making noises, I thought my brother entered my room so I turned and said shut the fuck up, turns out it was my mom and she ran at me while screaming and kept slapping my head) she\u2019s tried to push me off a chair when I refused to defend my aunt who is a terrible person. She\u2019s is constantly stressed out, it feels like she makes everything about her and I know that she\u2019s just struggling but I can\u2019t deal with it. The thing that angered me off the most was when I went to the hospital (mental health issues) and while I could tell there was genuine concern for me and she wanted me to get better, I can\u2019t say I enjoyed how that entire year and even still now she makes it about her. She\u2019ll tell me how much it affected her and talk about how much money she spent on me. I know this is all a lot and I do wanna say that I love her and she does a lot for me but how am I supposed to deal with someone like this? Help?",

Me dieron de alta una vez, y a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s me volvieron a internar, me dieron de alta por segunda vez, y despu\u00e9s volv\u00ed a intentarlo, hasta la \u00faltima vez, que fui internada en un centro para mujeres con problemas de no s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 tipo.\nPero ah\u00ed no ne dieron de alta, yo ped\u00ed que me sacaran porque era horrible estar ahi, una de las psic\u00f3logas insultaba de una manera horrible a una de mis compa\u00f1era que ten\u00eda anorexia y bulimia, y le dec\u00eda que estaba fea o que parec\u00eda un hueso o cosas por el estilo. En realidad nunca me gust\u00f3 ese lugar y creo que mis padres se dieron cuenta de eso, por eso decidieron sacarme. No me enorgullezco por las veces que intent\u00e9 suicidarme, se que le hice da\u00f1o a mis padres y no me hace feliz ser consciente de eso, pero nunca tuve la intenci\u00f3n de fallar a prop\u00f3sito para no morir en todas esas veces que lo intent\u00e9. Inclusive la \u00faltima vez que lo intente, pens\u00e9 que iba a ser la definitiva, que esa vez si iba a funcionar y que ya no iba a tener que lidiar con todo este asco y tristeza que siento por todo. Pero parece que tomarme 68 pastillas de las que encontr\u00e9 en el botiqu\u00edn de la casa no fueron suficientes para terminar con mi vida.\nQuiz\u00e1s si me hubiera tomado 100 hubiera funcionado, pero ya no hab\u00edan m\u00e1s pastillas. Recuerdo un d\u00eda que termin\u00e9 en un hospital pero esa vez, no fue por intento de suicidio, sino porque estaba tan triste que me tome una botella entera de vodka sin agua. Al parecer me choc\u00f3 porque no recuerdo nada y al d\u00eda siguiente termin\u00e9 en un hospital (olvid\u00e9 decir que los odio), sin saber porque estaba ah\u00ed. Me dijeron que estuve apunto de entrar en un coma etilico; pero no pas\u00f3. En fin, solo quer\u00eda recordar todo esto y desahogarme un poco. A\u00fan que eso no quite que me sienta igual o que lo quiera hacer de nuevo. Cuando lo hice por primera vez ten\u00eda 15 a\u00f1os, en ese entonces dure casi un a\u00f1o sin verme en ning\u00fan espejo, ni en mi cuarto, ni en la calle, ni en los reflejos de las botellas, cucharas o cosas as\u00ed. Y creo que estaba menos ansiosa porque no me ve\u00eda la cara, pero era terrible cuando accidentalmente me ve\u00eda.\nAutom\u00e1ticamente lloraba o me pon\u00eda muy triste y no quer\u00eda hacer nada por el resto del d\u00eda o quiz\u00e1s hac\u00eda las cosas pero casi sin ganas de nada, sin ganas de estar viva. El compararme con otras personas, especialmente chicas se hizo algo frecuente, no puedo dejar de sentirme inferior y fea cuando veo a otra chica, de la edad que sea y se vea como se vea.\nEn mi cabeza siempre soy yo la m\u00e1s fea. Nunca he tenido enamorado en persona. Y hubo un tiempo en  \n\nel que me deprim\u00ed porque pens\u00e9 que nunca nadie se iba a fijar en m\u00ed por tener la cara que tengo, pensaba que me iba a quedar sola toda mi vida a pesar de que, no dir\u00eda sue\u00f1o, pero, uno de mis anhelos en la vida es conocer a una persona que me ame tal y como soy y me vea como alguien bonita o suficiente para el. Pensar en que quiz\u00e1s tener algo bonito y sincero con alguien no est\u00e1 destinado para m\u00ed me da mucha tristeza y quiz\u00e1s un poco de celos por las personas que si pueden o si tienen la oportunidad de tener algo as\u00ed. Ahora ya no pienso que sea imposible del todo, pero si poco probable quiz\u00e1s. A\u00fan que mi mayor preocupaci\u00f3n no es eso, sino seguir teniendo la cara que tengo y tener que levantarme todos los d\u00edas igual tratando de aparentar que todo est\u00e1 bien conmigo, que no me pasa nada y que estoy bien cuando realmente estoy pensando en acabar con mi vida. Nunca entend\u00ed porque hay personas que me dec\u00edan que era bonita sin pregunt\u00e1rselos jam\u00e1s, o porque hab\u00edan chicos que me lo dec\u00edan, nunca entend\u00ed y no entiendo como puede haber personas as\u00ed. A veces pienso que esas personas, que me dijeron en su momento que soy bonita o me dan cumplidos sin ninguna raz\u00f3n, solo lo hacen por pena o l\u00e1stima hacia m\u00ed. Y no lo digo solo por personas de mi familia, sino por chicos del colegio, de la universidad o del trabajo. Nunca acept\u00e9 salir con ninguno de los chicos que me propusieron salir, y no porque no me parec\u00edan lindos, muchos de ellos eran realmente muy guapos, pero creo que me da algo de miedo salir con un chico (pese a que me gustar\u00eda tener pareja en alg\u00fan momento de mi vida). Siento que solo quieren jugar conmigo o que al final terminar\u00e1n haci\u00e9ndome da\u00f1o o cambi\u00e1ndome por una m\u00e1s bonita. Creo que no quiero sentir m\u00e1s dolor del que yo misma me hago sentir cada d\u00eda, eso ser\u00eda demasiado. Nunca he tenido una amiga, bueno, en realidad tuve una de 6to de primaria pero ya no nos hablamos porque me cambi\u00e9 de colegio y tuve otra (creo) en 1ro de secundaria, pero tampoco nos hablamos por el mismo motivo. Yo he pasado por muchos colegios, mis padres, mi hermano y yo nos mud\u00e1bamos constantemente y no recuerdo haber durado m\u00e1s de un a\u00f1o en alg\u00fan colegio, a excepci\u00f3n del \u00faltimo en el que estuve que fue un colegio de mujeres, en el que dure los \u00faltimos 4 a\u00f1os de secundaria antes de entrar a la universidad, y en esos 4 a\u00f1os no hice ni una sola amiga, lo cual es bastante triste y ahora me arrepiento de no haberlo intentado en vez de estarme comparando con todas mis compa\u00f1eras de sal\u00f3n. En fin, solo quer\u00eda recordar todo esto y desahogarme un poco. A\u00fan que eso no quite que me siento igual que antes. Pero creo que a\u00fan tengo la esperanza de que en alg\u00fan momento las cosas mejoren para m\u00ed y poder vivir una vida normal y tranquila, sin preocupaciones por mi cara y sin tenerle miedo a los espejos.

        "body": "I've been depressed for like 8 or so months, and it's only gotten worse and worse. I try to solve the issue that is making me feel bad, and before I manage, something else piles on. It's only gotten more severe, I've only gotten less motivated with every day. My family is completely horrible, always judging, always body shaming me, saying I can reach out to them for help, but then create an environment where the last thing I would want to do is reach out. I have 1 close friend who is always there for me, but I feel like all I am is a burden to him. I started dating for 4 months and I thought things where looking better for me, but I was just a desperate fool unable to notice the abuse and neglect in the relationship, and didn't notice how unhealthy it was, and despite how self destructive it was, I still battle with feelings whether or not I love him or not. Some days I hate him for how horrible he's treated me, others I wish I got another chance to be with him. I keep spiralling, I keep losing motivation to do anything, I've been eating incredibly little, I stopped doing any exercise, I stopped talking to anyone other than the 1 friend and brushing of others that try to talk to me, cos I feel like none of them are sincere and genuine, and I hate myself for how pathetic I am, and for how jealous I am of everyone around me that is better than me at everything. The idea of just making the pain stop with a couple pills is both terrifying and enticing. I want the pain to stop, but I know I will inflict pain on my family and friends, but I simultaneously don't feel like any of them are genuine, so what does it matter if i die? They wont care anyway. I don't know what to do, I spend so many nights crying alone, either hating myself for being worthless, or crying over a relationship that never should have happened, or crying while my mind is completely numb. I don't know what to do with myself, and I don't want to die, I'm too scared, but it also hurts so much. I want to feel better before I'm too deep to get out of this. I want a way out that doesn't end in me commiting suicide. I have seen so many suicide notes here, of people going though things so similar to me, and I am so scared to become another suicide note in this ocean of corpses that has amassed here.",

I have an emotionally unavailable mom, who walked in on me crying a while ago and told me to stop crying and grow up and to stop bringing sadness to the house. A girl said some things about me being ugly today, and it's just a confirmation to all my previous thoughts about myself. my hair is falling badly and I feel like I'm losing thr only thing that made me a little better looking. I had a lot of friends, now I no longer have any and I feel so alone. I'm so behind in school. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna fail in this semester.

        "body": "I have been depressed for a long time(since I was a teenager) and 2 year ago I wanted to end it. But in the end I couldn't, my father stopped me, he literally begged me to not do it , saying that he already lost his wife(cancer if you are curious) and he couldn't stand losing a son. You must understand that my father has always been rather stoic with me, so seeing him begging was very impactful....I mean,I was convinced and still am that my father raised me not out of love but rather for a sense of duty or in honor of my mother.  What I am trying to say that we have never been closed. Regardless of my attempt I could never been the male son that he wanted or deserved. So having such strong reaction from him was surprising. Continuing the story, my father made me promise that as long he lives I can't end myself. So I tried to get better , I followed the classical guideline to deal with depression. I went to a psychiatrist, I started medical treatment, psicological counseling and changed in life style(more sport,new diet ecc.). Also i decided to restart college and take my degree. I wanna make it clear that I put some major effort in solving ,but regardless of all this \"effort\" my condition didn't get better . Surely from the outside the situatiom seemed to improve(I am really good a facking when I want it).So much that my father he isn't worried anymore,but  i am still wanna end it. Everyday the desired is stronger and I don't know for how much I can go on. But at the same time I don't wanna break the promise..... \nI am becoming increasingly frustrated with my situation and don't know what to do. \nDo I really need to stand my depression for years(or least as long my father lives and he is relatively young so it is gonna be years)\nSorry for the rant\n ",

        "body": "Hi I\u2019m 15 and have recently been going through some things so anyway about 2 months ago I started feeling depressed (I\u2019m not diagnosed with depression but do get \u2018depressive episodes\u2019 if I can call them that) and it got to the point where I would only eat like some pasta every 2 days, never washed the bowls either just left them in my room where a few of them grew mold (yes mold) I would sleep all day, never showered or changed my clothes and started having thoughts of suicide and sh (has been a thing in the past especially last year but am 4 months clean) anyway I\u2019ve only just started to come out of this and have started feeling a little better again but I don\u2019t feel happy when I stay awake in the daytime. Like it\u2019s not my sleep pattern because I can change that whenever I want that\u2019s not a problem but I just hate being awake in the day. So recently I have been waking up at about 8pm and then staying awake all night and at about 6am, that\u2019s when I have a shower, get dressed, make my breakfast, wash my clothes and clean my room. Basically everything you would do in the day I do at night. And then at about 12am that is when I will go back to sleep. So last week was when I started to somewhat get into a routine again. I am still struggling some days with showering and changing my clothes but apart from that this weird schedule has kind of helped me a little. Anywaysssss I\u2019m just wondering like is it just me and why does my brain want to do this\ud83d\ude2d Also does anyone know if this sounds like depression, bi polar or if I\u2019m just lazy because I\u2019ve had people tell me all 3. My family on my mum and dads side both have history of mental health problems like depression, anxiety, CPTSD, BPD and I am on the waiting list for an appointment for an ADHD assessment \nEdit: this feeling of depression usually comes when I go through something that triggers me such as having to move from one care home to another or having an argument with a family member. But it does also come randomly but if nothing triggers it, it\u2019s less severe. I also don\u2019t go to school at the minute because of any reasons. Thanks for any help you might give!\ud83d\ude01",

Literally within the last hour I went magnet fishing with my dad, and I feel nothing.\n\n Everything was perfect. It was my preferred weather(rain), it was fun to get out of the house and explore, we even managed to catch a few rusty hooks and some small iron pebbles, but I still don't feel happy. I felt more joy imagining how it would go down (the exact scenario that actually happened), than when I actually got the chance to do it.\n\nThis happens all the time whenever I do something fun like going to the state fair, doing something fun on the rare chance I get to see my brothers, or even go to a Renaissance festival. No matter what I do, I just feel empty afterwards. \n\nI have no friends, no opportunities to make friends because I'm an online student, I don't like being alive(thankfully I'm not suicidal), and I barely have a reason to live other than just living. I've already mentioned my depression to my parents, but of course, that didn't go anywhere.\n\nI don't even know what I'm asking for, I just want to express myself for the first time",

        "title": "My Journey so far\u2026",
        "body": "I wrote this as a comment to another post, but felt maybe my journey is worth sharing on its own. \n\nI\u2019ve fought depression and intrusive thoughts my entire life (33m). I\u2019ve always been chunkier than my friends, even when I\u2019m in decent fit shape I look chunky if you see me with clothes on. I struggle with social anxiety and anxiety in general, I never feel fully confident in myself and I struggle with meeting new people.  I\u2019ve always felt inadequate, even when the world tells me I\u2019m good, and I\u2019ve had this \u201cwhy me?\u201d victim mentality for years. \n\nLast year, I got out of a relationship with someone I assumed to be my life partner after 11 years. It wasn\u2019t because of my issues, she was always supportive of that, but it fucking destroyed me and put me in the lowest low of my life. It motivated me to get real help, and find the best me. Learning to recognise my triggers through professional help was my first big step. It took me 3 different therapists to find one that I clicked with.\n\nFor me any form of social media binging is my biggest trigger, to the point that I now put a timer on for like 45mins or something to stop me falling into an episode.  I\u2019ll then switch it up to do some chores, read a book or go for a walk etc.\n\nI make sure to try and stay socially engaged with my friends, even when I don\u2019t feel like it. I\u2019ve always hated \u201calone time\u201d until I started working hard on it recently.\n\nI\u2019ve learned what \u201cself care\u201d means to me. I love to mountain bike personally (even though sometimes I resent going, that\u2019s normal), so I started building myself a self care routine around that. I\u2019ll go out and interact with the world to get a coffee etc, go for my ride, go for a sandwich at my favourite deli and then have some downtime. Then I\u2019ll reassess what I feel motivated to do that evening.\n\nI\u2019m learning that I have amazing qualities to my personality, and that I\u2019m a beautiful person in my own way. I\u2019m not perfect, but who is? People who portray themselves as \u201crock solid\u201d and show no vulnerability are the ones with the biggest insecurities.  The most toxic trait of depression is comparing yourself to others who are \u201cdoing great\u201d. I\u2019ve started thinking \u201cfuck them, I\u2019m on my journey\u201d. They all have issues and are probably thinking I have no issues.\n\nI\u2019m learning to communicate much more clearly, and that I can just say \u2018no\u2019 without a BS excuse when I don\u2019t want to do something. I\u2019m learning that me doing a favour/gesture for someone doesn\u2019t mean they have to return it. I\u2019m seeing that putting myself out there should be done from a place of love, not to get something in return. \n\nI\u2019m 100% still a WIP, and I still have days where I can\u2019t even do life, but the changes I\u2019ve felt in the last few months are unlike anything ever felt in my entire adult life. The world looks like a much better place, I\u2019m feeling more confident in my own unique self and I\u2019m looking forward to the rest of the journey ahead of me.\n\n I\u2019ve even noticed how my own happiness draws people to me, friends and dates. People actually enjoy being around me when I\u2019m my true self, that means a lot to me. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a \u201clook at me, I\u2019m fucking amazing\u201d post. I hope someone else out there can gain something from my journey, never give up on yourself!!",

        "body": "Sorry this is kinda long, I just need to say this somewhere. \n\nIt has been months since I attempted to go to \na work healthcare therapist, overall it's been years since I wanted to go to therapy at all. \nI have a long history with mental health problems, long term depression and major anxiety disorder are the biggest things I suppose, I've worked through so many things and my life has changed so much for the better over the years. \nBut I do have issues with self esteem that I just seem to never be able to get over. It's starting to affect my life again and I really want to not feel so shitty about myself all the time. \n\nSo this recent thing just won't stop coming back to me. I hate it, and it makes me feel like I was stupid for trying to get back to therapy. So I just need to let it out somewhere since I keep these things a secret from pretty much everyone irl.\n\nI had a couple of sessions, mostly because my anxiety and self hatred got so bad I started to have panic attacks at work. The first couple of times were fine, basic things u know. Thought exercises and going through stuff that I can try to get over my negative self talk. \n\nBut the last time I saw the therapist just kinda broke me. \n\nSo I have this thing where if I get too many work hours I completely begin to fall apart, I'm talking normal people hours are too much for me. I work in retail so sometimes I have double the work hours in a week. \nThe session was on my one day off in the middle of the week and I was already shaking and crying when I got there because I was so stressed, tired and anxious. I cry easily, I can have 5 panic attacks a day on bad times, so this was not a good time for me. I hoped it would make me feel a little better to talk about it so I still went. \n\nShe did not know what to say to me. It was awkward as hell sitting there in silence when she just stared at me and asked If I was going to keep crying. She asked questions to get my mind off of things I suppose but the thing is. I cry so hard if I think about good things while panicking because it makes me feel guilty, \n\nI told her that, but she wanted me to talk about stuff I did with my friends that week. I had a bit of a breakdown then and there. I kept shaking and bouncing my legs while crying hysterically. I said I was sorry to be like that instead of getting the proper words out, and I tried to calm myself down with breathing exercises. \n\nShe just stared at me. She looked so offended that I was even there. \nThen after I got myself to calm down I said some stupid joke about it all and laughed a bit. she just stared at me and sighed in frustration. \u201cI don't get what is there for you to cry about, we were talking about good things.\u201d Then she just stared at me, like I was stupid or something. \n\nI just said that sorry, I feel like I don't deserve good things and it just overwhelmed me. \n\nShe scoffed at that. Then said \u201cHonestly I don't understand what you want me to say to you anymore, you should have stayed home today.\u201d \n\nI don't even remember much after that. I thanked her for the previous sessions and left. I stared at my walls for the rest of that day. \n\nIt's been months but I can't stop thinking about that moment. I quit my meds too and I really should go see a doctor again but I can't bring myself to schedule a time. I feel so humiliated. I feel disgusted by myself for wasting anyone's time. Now I want to hide my problems again and that makes me feel so mad at everything since I haven't felt this bad in a while. Was I really so wrong for wanting therapy again? I feel so humiliated. \n\n",

        "body": "(23M) For the past 4 years, I have been going strong on a losing streak. Since 2020, I\u2019ve striving to achieve ANYTHING!! Graduating university, losing weight and being attractive, be consistent in my artwork/Youtube, revive my athletic career, build some savings and maybe finally start dating again lol. However, I\u2019m failing everyone and it\u2019s ALL my fault. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing, on paper\u2026I\u2019m doing everything right. \n* I have a decent job in my home town that fits in my psychology field.\n* For the past 3 years\u2026 I was about 330lbs, as of my I\u2019m back in the 200s at 280lbs. Even though I\u2019ll probably ruin my progress soon. \n* After being dismissed and fucked over a few years back, I\u2019m about 3 semesters (not counting summer classes) from graduating with a bachelors. Doing\u2026better academically??\n\nNot even trying to be self-deprecating but\u2026I\u2019m a pussy. All of my bullies were right! I can\u2019t finish anything that I started and was properly estimated. Sure, I have friends! Friends that I love to death. Although, the things that we love \u2026don\u2019t always love you back or the same way. There hobbies and outlets for me, but I CAN\u2019T take my foot off the gas now.\n* If I don\u2019t receive a B average by this semester end, I\u2019ll get dismissed again! Not to mention, I probably just failed one of my midterms. \n* My stepfather is retiring soon so my mom and I are going to have a rougher time helping pay for school. \n* A good chunk of my friends are graduating soon and I\u2019ll be here by myself. \n* Therapy hasn\u2019t really helped me either. They want me on meds but I don\u2019t want to live my life relying on that stuff. \n\nI just can\u2019t stop myself. Let me be completely honest with all of you, there are times where I just want to end myself! (I wrote my second suicide note last night). If things won\u2019t change if stop trying, then why tf haven\u2019t they? Trying is the reason why I\u2019m here in this hellhole alone. It\u2019s like there\u2019s two people in my mind. One of them yells:\n\n\u201cWhy are you STILL trying?!\u201d\n\u201cWhy do keep on letting yourself and others down?\u201d \n\u201cAre you trying to prove everyone that said that you\u2019re a soft, mediocre, pathetic and ugly waste of sperm correct?\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019re 23! Being a shy, awkward dork has NEVER been cute. Nobody wants that.\u201d\n\nEvery time before that voice finally pushes me to swallow those pills or  buy that gun\u2026the other voice makes a comeback. My spirit still wants me to prove others wrong and is determined to make something of myself! My spirit wants to give every obstacle and non-believer the middle finger and tell them to \u201cSTFU!!l\u201d Someone that\u2019s loved, has pride to their name and that\u2019s an overall decent person that didn\u2019t sell their soul. \n\nSorry for this is being SOOO long. I don\u2019t blame you for not reading any of it. I just needed to get that all out of me! Wish me luck on this amateur strongman competition this Saturday. Even though I won\u2019t win, I hope that I push myself to the point of heart attack. \n",

Tired of little things ruining my mood. I didn't ask for a brain this fucking complicated.\n\nYa wanna know another fucked up thing? I almost hate that everyone's attitude has changed when it comes to mental health. Like logically, I know it's better. I know it's beneficial and I want EVERYONE ELSE to be happy. The problem is, I finally adapted to the more negative society. I had it. And then, everyone flipped it. \"True strength is vulnerability\" and all that shit. It hits hard. Feels like a fucking attack on my fucking person. \n\nAlso, lets get real for a second. NO ONE likes me. Nope. No one at all. I'm an undesirable race, an undesirable gender, and I hide all this negativity underneath. People like me get shit on all the time for struggling. They let us know just how much they don't like us. As for the other two, I realize that I will pay for the sins of my forefathers as well as the sins of my peers. When people look at me when I'm out, they don't see me. No. They probably just see some opportunistic criminal. Doesn't help that I picked up a lot of slang words.\n\nBut maybe I deserve it. I'm not a good person. I'm really not. I've had thoughts that I shouldn't have. I've done things that I shouldn't have. Sometimes, I silently sympathize with the evil. I'm not a good person. I'm just valueless trash.

Today I have felt possibly the worst I ever have in my entire life, even worse than I would normally feel, I don\u2019t know why, my mind has just been finding every reason to be unhappy, all the positive motivation and thoughts I have have had are just gone. I used to be able to reason with myself that the negativity is just in my head (I know it is), but it\u2019s like I have no control at all over by brain, it feels like I\u2019m going insane. I then made the wrong decision to take out my emotions at the gym, I can\u2019t even work out now, it made me feel even worse for some reason, now I\u2019m sitting in my car, mourning the fact that I blew my shot at being happy. Any advice at all would really help, I feel like I can still fix this but I just don\u2019t know how, my head has just been all over the place.",

        "title": "Depression as a defense mechanism against something worse?",
        "body": "Hi!\n\nBeen depressed since I was in first grade, maybe even kindergarten if that's possible.\n\nThe last 5 years has been a battle (all the years have been really). It was when my first child was born that I realized something was wrong. To be in pain and doing everything I can to avoid it in every waking hour had worked ok minus up until then. Averaging a year, I could be performing ok for 8 months, I can do this, I just have to push through. No serene calm moments, only trying to escape.  \n\n\nDuring these last 5 years I have tried to keep calm. Accept the hurt, not fighting, sit there and take it. God damn it hurts. Now I am here. After all those minutes, hours, days, weeks, years, not getting ANY better. Counting the the number of times psychologists have nodded their head at me would be like counting the stars in the beautiful midnight sky. I think I know the reason for this depression though. A difficult childhood with no huge traumas, but just a general feeling of not ever being safe or even being taken care of and a huge dose of everything feeling like a big pile of sh... or chaos. I was always on watch for threats for some reason, and have been always.  \n\n\nThe child that was happy, eager, looking forward to every day with a huge amount of energy suddenly became this calm, controlled and quiet shell of itself. I have been searching for answers for so long and I think I may be on to something??? This is where I need your input.\n\nGoogle can be your friend I have heard. Maybe less now than before, but the search \"Depression the body's way to protect itself\" gave some insightful hits. (For me this is a new train of thought, I never saw depression as a symptom, just the illness itself)  \n\n\nThis article \"[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/shouldstorm/202012/we-ve-got-depression-all-wrong-it-s-trying-save-us](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/shouldstorm/202012/we-ve-got-depression-all-wrong-it-s-trying-save-us)\" describes something that I feel in my core. I recently experienced anxiety like never before after I got really ill from a virus that just teared me down like nothing else. My two kids, who have not turned 6 yet had to go a whole day with a packet of crackers. I was unable to take care of them. This is also were my defenses, my depression and my flight responses had to bow, my brain did no longer have the energy to \"use\" depression as a defense mechanism. \n\nWhat happens when the defense is gone? The real threat appears. The one that has been hidden for almost 30 fucking years! The anxiety. This feeling of terror and nothingness. The feeling that the whole existence is in danger, my kids, my fianc\u00e9e, my life, my efforts, everything in my life was just not important, existence was this fleeting feeling of vulnerability and even not existing at all. Everything felt as it could disappear in a second. Nothing lasts more than a second in the universes' time scale.  \n\n\n**So sorry for the looong f' read. I just hope someone can offer their thoughts on this subject. Can depression be a defense mechanism against something far worse?** Something that really disables the body from doing any action? I swear, when my body was immobilized by this anxiety I could do nothing, not anything at all. With depression I can hurt and hurt and hurt and have moments of strength were I can cook, mow the lawn and other small tasks, if even for just an hour of a week. I have been through pills and alcohol - nothing works as you know, it's just trying to cope, whatever it takes.  \n\n\nThank you for reading and good luck in your endeavors, whether you can help me or not. I really hope we can get better, all of us.",

This might be a stupid question but are these considered real suicidal thoughts even though I\u2019ve never seriously concluded \u201cim going to kill myself tonight\u201d, it\u2019s only been a sort of fascination.",

        "body": "My (20f) boyfriend and fianc\u00e9 (20m) of two years broke up with me almost two days ago. He was an amazing boyfriend. He was my person. We were going to spend forever together. We were forever and always. He was my best friend. I had my mom and him and my best friend who goes to college several hours away. I\u2019ve come close twice to ending my life in the past 48 hours. He was my life. Life just isn\u2019t worth living without him. I tried talking to him, but his mind is made up. I couldn\u2019t sleep last night. I kept waking up from nightmares of him with other girls and being so happy and loving with them. I shivered and sweat all night long, bawling my eyes out. They never teach you about heartbreak. This is the worst pain I have ever felt, and I\u2019ve gone through an IUD insertion. I have less than a half a semester left of college before I graduate and I just don\u2019t think I can do it. We have biology together and I struggle a lot in the class. He says he\u2019s going to withdraw since he doesn\u2019t even need it. He\u2019s going for an EMT certification and he only needed so many classes. I can\u2019t focus and I can\u2019t eat anything without throwing up. Drinking juice is too much. I know I caused it all and I hate myself. I know I shouldn\u2019t deserve to eat or do anything for me. I feel so empty and just utterly gutted. I just want to die, I don\u2019t want any feeling. I don\u2019t want to feel this. I love him so much. I always will.\n\nWe planned to move away and start our own family.\n\nI\u2019m blind-sided. He tells me that we\u2019re just too different from each other. (Aren\u2019t many people in good relationships different from each other?) My head is swirling trying to remember details. We have little arguments and fights over stupid things, and I\u2019ve learned that I start most of them, but I\u2019ve been getting better at resisting and just becoming more chill and sensitive. We\u2019re both stressed and exhausted. He says he\u2019s tired of all of the fights. I always try to help him with anything, and he spoiled me. I would clean his house when he didn\u2019t have time. He says we\u2019re toxic. I promised him things would change. I gave him some time but I couldn\u2019t keep myself from him. I got him his favorite breakfast and a nice coffee (he loves coffee) this morning and tried to figure things out, mend them. I tried to stay calm. I ended up begging him and he just told me to go home. I was crying really hard and he looked me in the eyes and said \u201csee how I\u2019m not even crying? I don\u2019t care anymore, I\u2019m done. We\u2019re done. You need to go home now.\u201d He\u2019s not one to really cry and show emotions like that. I\u2019m his opposite, and I cry all the time over everything.\n\n I fucked up so bad. He told me to go date other guys and forget about him. He told me that he\u2019s already begun to forget about me. I could never. I could never move on and date other guys. I love him with everything in me. I love him so much. I\u2019m lost. I wish I had a Time Machine. This all started over me being upset that he didn\u2019t want to come see me when he had promised to come help me move some stuff out of the house so he could move in when his lease is up in June. I really wanted to see him and spend time with him. I want him so bad. ",

I have no friends left (if I ever did have any real ones) the Bible is the only thing that helps make me feel better but it only can do so much.

        "body": "Hello everyone,\n\nI know that burnout might not really be a type of depression, but I don't know where else to go.\n\nI (34 F), work as a Technical Consultant for a fairly big company. Since I have many years of expertise, my rank is \"Senior\", so I am usually a source of help for other colleagues who need assistance.\n\nI currently have 7 projects where I implement technical solutions for our customers. I have phases where I am extremely productive, wake up early, get a lot of things done. However, I'm currently in a phase where it is extremely hard for me to work. I feel the burden even more because as a Senior I'm a valuable ressource of the company and some projects will literally never move along if I don't work on them. I am both grateful and scared of being in this position. I've worked so hard all my life to get to where I am. I'm single, earn extremely well, live alone and have the best ever relationship with my family. They never ask for it, but I always give them money just so they can have it easier in life and I do it happily. I recently bought my parents a house too. All of these things fulfill me and it's a way for me to express my gratitude towards my parents who raised me. I have no thoughts of self-harm or suicide at all, I am usually very fun-loving and active.\n\nI've been doing this job for 8 years already and the first few years, I was going to the office and wasn't allowed to take the laptop home. Homeoffice wasn't a thing back then. However, ever since the pandemic, working from home has become a big thing and now we work 100% homeoffice. Of course I love it, I can be with my cat, can accept packages when they arrive, can do my laundry, the dishes, etc in between meetings when I find a few minutes and don't have to leave it all for after work, which gives me more time to relax after work. All of this is nice, but for a few months now I've been in an extreme slump. I can't motivate myself to work hard, I don't have any fun doing the job I once loved, I keep postponing everything (and I mean everything) I work on, so bad that it exceeds the delivery date and never gets delivered unless a C-level person literally yells at me to get my sh\\*t together. At this point, I'm just surprised they didn't fire me yet because I messed up quite a few times.\n\nMy colleagues notice it, my family notices it, I only ever want to sleep, I keep finding reasons to take a nap in the middle of the day (I nap every single working day, for at least 2-3 hours). I used to wake up at 5 AM every morning to go to the gym, but those days feel so far away (even though I was just like that up until the beginning of the year). I don't understand what's happening and I'm really scared of losing my job, but even the fear of losing my job can't bring me to work on anything.\n\nI tried visiting the office once a week in the last month and I noticed I can work a bit better from there but nobody besides me goes there. It's literally a huge building with not a single soul in it. I have the keys to the office and I'm the only one there. It depresses me when I don't see my colleagues face to face. Seeing and interacting with people raises my spirits and makes me work harder (just like going to the gym and seeing other people workout motivates me to workout more than following a workout video on Youtube at home). But it's impossible for me because everyone prefers Homeoffice. It went so far that I even considered the worst: quitting my job at this company and moving to another company where they have less Homeoffice, but even though I've been looking for weeks, I can't find any company like that that's not too far away for me to go to every day. The area I work in just generally does not have a high Office-Working quote.\n\nI'm on the verge of having a burnout, all the symptoms I have clearly point to it and I've made an appointment with my therapist about it, but it's not until a few weeks later due to her busy schedule.\n\nWhat can I do, how can I prevent myself from feeling such fatigue and exhaustion and how can I get out of the slump I'm in? I feel useless for my company. And the more I feel like this, the more I realize that I define my self-worth through my work, because I feel like I have nothing else in life that will keep me upright. If I give up working and take a sabbatical, I feel like I'll entirely let go and lose myself. I need a routine and a strict office policy to keep me away from home. I even thought about just leaving my laptop at the office so that I'd be forced to go there the next day...\n\nI know it's very long, please forgive me, but I really need help. I don't think I'm in a state where I need medical help, but I'm sure that if I keep doing this for another 1-2 weeks, I will be in a full blown burnout and I want to prevent it. At this point, I'm just happy I recognized the symptoms before it was too late. Please let me know your thoughts and thank you for reading.",

But my god do I feel like it sometimes. \n\nMy father had been married before he met my mother so I have two half sisters. They are 10 and 15 years older than me. I idolized my sisters when I was younger, but they have always disliked me and my mother. They blame my mother for the divorce (all though my parents met while my dad was in the middle of divorce) and by proxy they blame me. Growing up it felt like my dad favored my sisters, because he would try to make up for the divorce. In fact my mother wasn\u2019t allowed to tell anyone about her pregnancy with me until four months because he didn\u2019t know how to brake the news to my sisters. My sisters always post on social media about how much they love each other. We got a baby book of my niece last Christmas and I wasn\u2019t even in it while my other sister got named \u201cthe world\u2019s best aunt\u201d. My father doesn\u2019t stick up for me and my mom is not in any position to tell them off because things are already tense between them.\n\nBecause of this, I feel like a mistake. Like I\u2019m a failed experiment or the B-version of a human. No matter what I do I will never garner any kind of success because my value is fundamentally lower than that of others.\n\nI can\u2019t visualize any future outside of highschool.

I'm short for an adult male. I'm a poc and I deal with the negatives from it\u2014the expectations to be a certain way, the profiling, the stereotypes, the microaggressions, the uneasiness. My own people sometimes I feel like I can hardly relate to and they unironically do the most roasting/judging/mistreatment on average. I have social anxiety. At times I feel depressed. I am awkward. I am boring. I have a resting face. I have so much debt accruing it's not even funny. Jobs are extremely hard to get and these places just continue to ghost you and hit you with the same false closers \"we should get back to you on X/Y/Z day.\" It's bad that I'm wasting my time going to these places just to hear a soft gust of wind in response. If I'm not a good fit or my availability doesn't work for you just let me know preferably as soon as you can, don't have me thinking if I will get it or not. Either that or they're a scam. Or in some of the obscure places they will pretend the job doesn't exist. One time I put on my formal attire and headed to a far town just for the staff to pretend like they had no idea what I'm talking about as I come in and inquire about the interview they set up. \n\nI don't have friends or relationship so I can't bug anyone with my struggles beside close family. I cannot relax out for fun anymore due to all the mistreatment and judgement I face for being ugly. I'm hardly taken seriously as a very short man. My resting face offends people and sometimes they will constantly ask are you ok when I am. It's tough to eat healthy like I want to. Healthy stuff is way too expensive. Hell, even junk food now is becoming more expensive. The debt is piling up and I'm getting so tired\u2014I now owe like 10 different places at once. My score is hitting rock bottom. \n\nEverything feels useless. My life feels repetitive and stagnant. I am extremely flawed. I can never ever shake the feeling that \"everyone hates me.\" When I'm kind to others I even have some people using derogatory slang toward me for being so and insinuating that I'm weak. I have people getting offended that I keep to myself but it's like I've been pushed to be this way. There's too much else to write in this rant so I will have to continue later. \n",

I don\u2019t ever want to see myself as a victim instead a survivor. I was sexually abused and raped by a teacher in elementary school. This teacher was someone I trusted and made me feel safe and like I meant something. I was picked on constantly by other kids from 1st grade to 3rd grade. And this teacher was the only one who stood up for me and made me feel important, and for awhile it felt great and fun, until he started to touch me, and I\u2019m pissed off at myself now because I wish I had to confidence to say no back then like I do now. Idk why I let it happen, I let it go on for so long, and I didn\u2019t like it but at the same time I didn\u2019t want to get picked on. When I hit 4th grade the teacher left me alone in fact he straight up stopped being nice to me, in his own words he said \u201cyou\u2019re too old for me now\u201d\n\n    He did eventually do time, that only happened after the abuse and when I went through a serious self harm phase. But still he did the damage and I  never felt like a kid anymore.

However, the symptoms of my depression/anxiety/PTSD started to come back around November 2023 and I was prescribed the same 25mg zoloft meds once again since it worked great last time.\n\n  \nI was definitely not prepared for the side effects I got the second time around, sexual dysfunction being the most annoying of the bunch imo. Before going on SSRIs, I knew that they often came with a whole bunch of sexual side effects like lower libido/erectile dysfunction/inability to orgasm/vaginal dryness/lower sensitivity/etc. But I guess I should've known better than to just assume I'd have the same experience my 2nd time on antidepressants. Luckily, my libido is still somewhat high + I can still orgasm + my body still retains the same sensitivity, but I can barely get wet no matter what.\n\n  \nI naturally have a very high libido and getting wet used to be an extremely easy and almost instant thing whenever i got in the mood. Sex also means a lot to me since physical touch is one of my main love languages. My boyfriend (21M) is super sweet and understanding, but i'm honestly just really sad because it makes me feel hollow, like i'm missing a part of my body :(\n\n  \nI stopped tapered off the meds again \\~3 weeks ago because of how much it bothered me, but nothing has changed. For anyone who's more knowledgeable on the subject and/or has experienced this before, did your sexual dysfunction symptoms go back to normal eventually? And how long did it take to see that progress?",

Little things that are making me feel paranoid. I feel mistreated in that place, and I am feeling that I have to maintain constant silence because after all I know that whatever they did to me is my fault for being a bad person.  I'm a terrible person. Or an idiot.\nI don't know really.\nSo, Today at home I tried to explain to my husband how I was feeling. He asked me what was wrong with me... it was a disaster. We ended up fighting... I mean, when I tried to explain to him he told me that he didn't know how to help me... things like all the time it's the same with you, there's nothing to be done, everyone has bad days, life was made to enjoy it... things like that...\nI didn't get any peace from that conversation with my husband, nothing... it was worse, because now I feel like I'm a real nuisance to him and that I'm pushing him down, you know? \nI told him I'm going to ask my psychiatrist to put me on prozac and seroquel again... I hate those meds, they kill what little libido I have...  He told me that he doesn't want me to take that and such... which is a lie... he's probably desperate for me to shut my mouth and let him have some peace... I will ask for the medication because the problem is me... that I'm sick...\n\nEdit: The fact that no one has replied to this post also makes me feel like shit. ",

Plus I don't even know what to say because I was never allowed to express myself.\n\nI had to move to a different country by myself because the people there were too homophobic and racist and aggressive The very same were my own family and old friends. I'm queer, I couldn't stand their racism and how unfair it was that they still abused me even tho I was just minding my own business. Once I moved out to a different country, I was homeless for like two months, then I got into an governmental accommodation for young homeless adults, but the people in that dorm are just drug addicts and convicts that are over 4 years older than me, and I have to share a dorm room with two of them. One of them is also from the country I left, and he's been bullying me just because I'm quiet, the same like the ones I had to deal with in highschool. Four months passed since I had to live with the morons and it's just terrifying because I never know when they'd just try to provoke me to a fight and they'd bully me. I told the managers of the accommodation, but they just gave the morons some warnings. I've tried to secure a job, but no luck since I'm just 18 and I don't have any experience. I just don't know how to manage to stay motivated anymore when it doesn't seem like anything will get better and I just have to endure more trauma. \n\nTL;DR: I've had a very traumatic time growing up. I moved to a different country by myself. It's not getting better and I don't know what to do.\n",

I'll be graduating in a few weeks and have no idea how I'll ever get a job because of my condition. Talking to strangers makes me physically sick, so interviews are going to be impossible. I'm losing hope that I'll ever be a part of society again. I've been using programming to hide my depression and hopelessness from my parents. They see me working 10+ hours a day on my projects and school and are proud of what I'm doing. But I know I'll disappoint them and never be able to get a job. I'm almost 29 and I'm stuck. I've contemplated trying to end it again because I don't see a future for myself. I cover up my depression and anxiety with hypersexuality but even that isn't helping anymore.  I never talk about this stuff but the closer I get to graduation the more I lose hope for a future. If I don't break out of this cycle by the end of the summer and find a job I'll attempt to end it again, learned for my last attempts and won't make the same mistakes. ",

        "body": "I (26F) have been getting these intense urges of wanting someone to hurt me. I want someone to pin me to the ground, hold my wrists next to my head so I can\u2019t move. I often have fantasies of a man doing this to me, punching me and cutting me while he laughs, and I struggle. Lately I\u2019ve been picturing a specific fictional character doing this to me. \n\nI get an adrenaline rush from these daydreams, and often feel a lot happier. They bring me comfort. And this isn\u2019t in anyway sexual. I just want someone to beat me up. \n\nSince a young age, I\u2019ve read fanfiction and role plays that involve these things happening to the reader. I would get that same adrenaline rush. \n\nI also have some self-destructive thoughts, but these daydreams are more intense. \n\nI was sexually abused as a kid, but it could have been way worse. And I was probably emotionally abused too. But I was never hit or punched or anything like that as a kid. \n\nI know these thoughts aren\u2019t normal, but I don\u2019t want to lose them either. I don\u2019t engage in anything like that in real life. \n\n",

This message is probably going to be hella long so choose to read it if you want to. \n\nFirst things first, to every single one of you (yeah especially you) I just want to say I\u2019m glad you\u2019re still here with us. I know it\u2019s not easy, but the fact that you\u2019re still here makes me happy. Don\u2019t give up!\n\nNow, on to me\u2026It\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve last posted in here. Let me tell you a few things some of them are good things. I started dating the sweetest, wonderful, and most amazing guy ever (we\u2019ve known each for about 4 years.) \n\nWe started dating in September of last year and he has been the best person to come into my life. He is so thoughtful and so caring. He knows about all my mental issues and my family my/ home situation. And he doesn\u2019t judge me for that. He loves me for me. \n\nI recently got my permit (I am an adult btw I just never knew how to drive please don\u2019t judge me) and he\u2019s been teaching me how to drive and I finally saved up enough money to buy a decent car and I\u2019m so happy. I\u2019ve worked so hard to get this far and I\u2019m glad he was apart of it. \n\nI really can\u2019t wait to marry this man and have a family together I know it hasn\u2019t been that long since we\u2019ve started dating, but we\u2019ve already talked about it and even his mom asked when will he propose haha. I\u2019m looking forward to it. \n\nNow on to the shitty parts\u2026Well I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 (damn fam you couldn\u2019t let me inherit a mass fortune?) and I have depression on top of that too? Not to mention pmsing. I feel really bad for my boyfriend I\u2019m glad he loves me even when I go a little bit crazy sometimes lol\n\nI am currently on three medications and I\u2019m just really tired of having to keep to a routine schedule of making sure I take them. I don\u2019t really have an appetite anymore, like I\u2019m hungry but every time I try to eat something I can\u2019t finish it and I just want to go back to sleep. \n\nI feel really weak and tired. I haven\u2019t been sleeping either ( my psychiatrist prescribed me an antipsychotic that\u2019ll put me to sleep, I\u2019ll give it a try.) sometimes I don\u2019t even want to get up to pee and I\u2019ll just hold it until I can\u2019t no more and then I\u2019ll get up to use the bathroom. \n\nI haven\u2019t taken a bath in two weeks and I feel disgusted with myself and I told my boyfriend that and he tells me \u201cBabe you\u2019re not disgusting, I love you and I want to help you.\u201d I think I\u2019m about to start my period and this bitch is taking her time coming, so I\u2019ve been extremely moody and irritable.\n\nPractically every night I\u2019m on the phone with him crying uncontrollably (sometimes till I pass out like a baby lol) and he\u2019s always there to comfort me and tell me it\u2019s going to be alright. \n\nHe is my light and one of my favorite person ever. He gives me a reason to wake up every day (even though sometimes it\u2019s really hard to) because I look forward to us sharing a lifetime together and build a family together and strengthening our bond. \n\nMy dudes\u2026He is indeed the one! The tunnel may be dark right now, but just keep going and you\u2019ll find the light. (That was cliche and cringe lol but no seriously though keep going, because you\u2019re amazing and we all love you. Also you\u2019re a bad ass bitch too!) ",

I am very different from others.\n\n Since lockdown since 15 I am that way. I never made any memories . Not done anything . Not learned anything no skill life skill anything . Now outside world feels very burden. Also I feel childhood is finally over . I feel very adult . My senses becoming very sharp about my surroundings . It feels I am sensative to everything happening around me I don't feel innocent anymore. My interest is just nothing . I wasted all my teen life becoming perfect comparing my every details to others. Now I feel like a loser\n\n I also think God has left me . Before I used to feel like something is with me there is some hope that I can make things good after lockdown. I don't like changes. I still watch YouTube videos which are made for about 12-14 age of people and I have nobody in my life . I am just unable to talk to anybody. I have also working problem in which I get struck while working anything which requires physical work. My interests are in astrology psychology. I also obsessed with perfectionism due to which I think I did nothing.\n\n I spent all my teenage time doing all this bullshit . I wasted all my time in phone seeing things related to these . Also movie and game reviews . Top 10 movies this and that. All this just kind of killed innocence in regarding the world. Now theories coming and I see answers in Google now my mind I overflowing with knowledge that nobody have around my age. Sometime I feel like dying and I wish there would be someone else who would have been born in my family instead of me who would make my parents proud by scoring good marks in class 12 boards. What is the use of my parents time till now in me.my past is already doomed now my future will get doomed seeing the person I am now . I am just not normal. ",

My partner is unable to work due to their greencard expiring and this gives them no option to find a job. I know they try their best by streaming or cleaning or trying to cook and I greatly appreciate it but its still hard. I'm barely home, my bones hurt, and my mental health has all but vanished. All I get time to do at home is maybe eat and sleep. I don't find anything fun or enjoyable anymore and even a smile fades so quickly. My partner already knows the tremendous stress I'm in with student loans and paying the rent, let's just say I barely come out even if not a few hundred bucks under. \n\nDidn't get my dream job after college and now been working as a maintenance engineer trying to learn and build my career in a different way.  Been working for a good 3 years now still no promotion while I've seen someone newer and less experience get a promotion above me. I've even taken a few electrical and boiler classes in hopes to help more and hopefully build a better future for learning to get paid more and im usually just ignored. Its quite frustrating but as I always say it is what it is and I need these 2 jobs to pay to feed everyone. \n\nI'm just tired, some days I don't even remember driving home or to work. Don't even feel like eating much just somen ramen most night so i can afford bills. Some nights I just look at the ceiling and think perhaps it's just easier to end it but yet i keep getting up day after day. I was just wondering if others may have some ways of surviving , figuring out happiness, or just something to get by is all.",

I actually made friends all on my own. I cut out the people causing me the most pain over a year ago today.\n\nBut it feels like it isn't enough. My mom comes home everyday with an offhand remark about my existence. So far, she's brushed off every instance of me trying to express myself and change myself for the better. I went to college because of her, and I got a job because of the shame she makes me feel every single day.\n\nEveryday, it feels like I'll never be loved. Not truly. No matter how hard I try I'll never be enough for anyone. Not my family, or my friends. My dad and my cat are the only things keeping me going, and even then, I know I'm letting him down too. I did all I could on my own (they were never really there for me emotionally) but I'm so tired. I'm tired every day and I can't stand living some days.\n\nI can't stand knowing the mistakes I've made and I can't stand not being enough even tho I tried so hard to pick myself up after all the emotional abuse I've endured. It feels like it was all for nothing everytime I wake up in the morning.\n\nI had a dream to write a story a lot of people would enjoy. But I can't even find the motivation or inspiration to continue existing,  let alone to write something like that. I can't even find the motivation to get out there and show people who I am anymore. I always get hurt anyway. I wanted to be a mom one day, even if it was hard. But I fear I'll end up like my mom so bad. I can't think of anything else to do but die and hope my dad can forgive me for it. He has a successful son to look forward to, as opposed to his socially inept failure of a daughter.\n\nAt least I can look in the mirror without feeling much shame anymore. But that doesn't amount to much in the end. Not when I'm unlovable and unable to keep my emotions in check.",

I need to get out of bed, but I just can't move. I'm honestly thinking of just killing myself. Being alive is way too much effort.

I cant get therapy without clinics, because I am always so extremely tired that I miss most of my appointments. My tiredness is basically my whole personality I sleep in average 11-13 hours with hughe variety, i slept on time over 24h without any medication. If I am awake I play video games, I have hughe problems trying to learn a new skill, becaus of how much I learned if I cant do it I should not do it.\n\nI basically wait untill holidays so I can meet my brothers, wich I have a good connection with, but outside of that they don't have much free time.

        "body": "I'll start this off by saying, no im not suicidal. So I apologize because I know the title gives off that vibe. I'm more so just needing to vent. \n\nI married my high-school girlfriend, and we were together for 10 years. I gave her the world, worked my ass off to the bone, so she could pretty much have and do whatever she wanted. She never knew financial struggle. However, what we built for 10 years, took her 10mins to completely destroy when she cheated on me. And it fucking BROKE me. Took me a long time to heal from that. \n\nNow here I am, about a year and a half later, and been trying get back out there, but I'm worried it's too late for me. I'm almost 30, outta shape, and would be generous in saying I'm a 5 outta 10. I fear I won't meet that special someone again. Hell, I don't even know how to talk to women. I get to shy and awkward. Due to my looks, I probably come off as creepy. \n\nThe worst part, I'll never have a family of my own. Ever since I was a kid, I always wanted that sitcom life, ya know? A wife and a couple kids. But I feel that ship as sailed for me. Guess I just gotta get use to it. \n\nI've tried all the dating apps, and it's always the same story. I'll swipe right on 1000 girls, and the only time I get a match, is when it's either some bot, scam account, or some chick promotion her OF.  \n\nIt's really fucking with me mentally. All my friends have their families now, and here I am. The dude that was blinded by love and didn't see the snake, and it's too late for me to recover and have the life I always wanted. ",

        "body": "Every day I wake up and the world feels dull. Like one of my senses is missing, or a color has been removed from my palette. It feels like I'm following in footsteps that were carved by a beast millions of years ago, and I've been told to follow the trail even though it's been buried under the soil for a millenia. I suppose it's hopelessness, the feeling that things won't get better and that no matter what I do there will always be a hole in my sinking ship, but I don't even know if it's that.\n\nMy own thoughts differ from my actions so much I'm starting to get confused on who I really am. When I talk to my therapist or family, I'm self-aware and self-hating yet willing to make a difference. When I talk to strangers I'm outgoing and funny. When I talk to friends I'm loud and entertaining. When I'm alone, I'm just a piece of the wall. I fill in the spaces left by others and exist there until another hole opens, and I move to that one.\n\nI went to college because I was told I need to to get a good job. I was told I need a good job so I can make money. I was told I need to make money in order to live. And I'm told I need to live because those around me will miss me if I don't live. I'm tired of being told this same order of events. I'm tired of being told what to do, yet when I'm not told what to do I don't know what to do. So I don't do anything.\n\nI started college and by the second semester I was barely going to classes. They just don't feel challenging. They always were interesting when I went, but they felt ultimately pointless. It's all things I've either heard before or just simply felt unimportant. I tried multiple subjects, tried multiple classes, but every time I would just sit in the back of the room, under stimulated and barely conscious of the world around me. \n\nAnd then there's the assignments. So mind-numbingly boring that I wanted to slit my throat with ever written word, with every corrected comma. For fucks sake after hearing about APA style for the 30th time, you start to stop giving a fuck about it and just write however the fuck you want, because that bitch who just assigned 14 pages on a dude who died old and racist because \"he had such a huge impact on the world.\" I DONT GIVE A FUCK. Stop telling me what I have to know. Why can't I figure out what I need? Why do I have to be told that this is what's known, this is what's necessary, this is what you need this is what we need, this is how you do this. FUCK OFF. \n\nThat's not really the problem. I'm just tired. Anyways, on the rare time I managed to sit through the assignment and finish it, it was a coins flip if I'd actually even remember to turn the damn thing in, because ADHD decided that my brain will develop at about half the pace of the average human, so hey I may be 20 but I have the mental and emotional fortitude of a 15 year old, anyways time to pick out what I want to do for the rest of my life!\n\nI just want to be done",

        "body": "Why do you hurt yourself?\n\nBecause I believe I should.\n\nWhy do you wander?\n\nBecause I have nothing else to do.\n\nSeeing pictures of other people. Walking down the street and looking at the faces of strangers.\n It lights the coals of my burning self hatred. To see someone be so beautiful. And me so detestable.\n I thinks it\u2019s part of the reason I\u2019m more interested and more attracted to people who look Imperfect. Especially when they have more weight on them. \n\nWhen I see someone truly beautiful my brain immediately tells me to basically ignore them out of fear. My brain puts the dots together for me and tells me I\u2019m sewage compared to them and thus am unworthy of speaking to them and that it\u2019s impossible that a connection could be made. Despite this my mind zooms in on them when I first see them. I imagine a thousand possibilities. I imagine different freak scenarios which I\u2019ve only heard of through word of mouth and movies. Then they leave my sight forever. And I come to the old immovable truth. That it will always be a fairytale. Images of gripping bed sheets and laughing watching movies are extinguished by her back walking away. I don\u2019t know her. And I never will. \n\nThe same girl walks into my sight. Only she\u2019s about 30 or 50 pounds heavier. I\u2019m more attracted to her. Why? Because my brain believes that the chances of her finding me attractive and actually being with her are higher. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m beautiful. I feel ugly, like a beaten pig. Therefore I can\u2019t believe that others will and that they will accept me. So when I find someone who I think could share the same problems based on quick and rude judgements I find it more believable they\u2019ll accept me. Because truth be told I\u2019ll accept anyone. And I hate that. I hate that I\u2019m that shallow. That I\u2019m that pathetic and disrespectful about people and woman. My mind sees many woman as saviours. As objects for my pleasure. Not just physically but mentally too.\n\n The toxic waste leaks out of my ears. I have a lot of issues. And I\u2019m scared of loving someone because of that. I\u2019m scared of hurting someone. I\u2019m scared of being hurt. I\u2019m scared of shame.  I\u2019m scared of not being enough. I want to be held and told its alright and I\u2019m perfect and that I don\u2019t have to be anything else then what I am. In the fetal position being held by someone safe. Shushing my cries and whimpers. The saviour complex. An excuse for weaklings like me to ignore their problems. \nThere\u2019s this thought that keeps popping up in my head. That if I was American. I\u2019d probably be dead. I would have gone into mams closet and unlocked the gun safe. Then I would have shot myself in the head. So easy. Too easy. I\u2019m scared of that thought yet I want it so bad in my darkest times. Just pick something up and point and click. So quick you can\u2019t change your mind. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m grateful I\u2019m European or spiteful because I\u2019m not. That eternal sleep. The infinite blackness which consumes me like a warm bath. It calls to me. But for now I must tell it to wait. \n ",

I think I just feel worse at times when I should probably feel just the usual amount of sadness? It\u2019s like I spiral, or recently, I\u2019ve noticed that there\u2019s this new feeling. \n\nI feel this panic or dread? It\u2019s like a new low. Like, I have felt low before but it\u2019s now going even lower. Like I\u2019ve unlocked a new part of my depression? I don\u2019t want to end my life, but during that low my mind sometimes goes to that? \u201cWhat if..\u201d y\u2019know? I know I shouldn\u2019t and I never will because I am terrified of doing something like that but sometimes it just, I dunno. It\u2019s there, and I hate that it\u2019s there. \n\nI don\u2019t know if writing this will really help? I wish I could just stop feeling this way because I\u2019m really sick of it. I\u2019m thinking about finding a new therapist? She\u2019s helpful sorta? I honestly feel like it\u2019s my own fault. I don\u2019t have any long term goals with my mental health? And each session, she asks me what\u2019s the goal of the session, and I really don\u2019t know. I usually end up talking about something like my social anxiety (I manage it pretty well already, I just sometimes forget about my tools), or something else that\u2019s brief? She helps though! But I feel like I keep going back to the same issues? \n\nAnyways, I still feel this panic and dread? I\u2019ve cried, texted a friend, did some deep breathing, and even drew something but I still feel it. It\u2019s sitting on my chest and for some reason I can feel it I my stomach as well. I hate this and honestly I don\u2019t know if this is depressions doing? Maybe this is an anxiety thing? But yeah, typing this helped a little. \n",

I have an amazing family and love my parents so much so i could never do something like that to them. Idk why i\u2019m even posting this but i don\u2019t have friends to talk to. I have definitely hit rock bottom, the only way to go from here is up right? I struggle with addiction, did it to myself. Addiction runs in my family and i got the gene. But today was a wake up call and i needed a real consequence like this to happen for me to realize what path i was going down. It\u2019s not a path i want to be on. I know things will get better with time but it\u2019s just hard to see that right now. I feel like the shittiest person ever and i wish i could just sleep forever to stop the thoughts. ",

        "body": "Hello, I'm reaching out because I've been struggling with various challenges in my life, and I feel like I need some support to navigate through them. It's been a difficult time, and I'm not sure how to cope with everything on my own.\n\nSince the pandemic started, I've been feeling isolated and lonely, spending most of my time at home. This has led to feelings of boredom and disconnection, especially since I've been studying from home due to the lockdown. Despite graduating from grade 8 and starting half of grade 9 at home through modular learning, I've been feeling increasingly anxious and depressed. I've noticed changes in my behavior, such as becoming more withdrawn, nervous, and experiencing racing thoughts, especially when interacting with others.\n\nAdditionally, I've been struggling with perfectionism, which is a new experience for me. I used to be more outgoing and talkative, but now I find myself feeling shy and anxious in social situations. I've also noticed that I've become more self-critical and prone to stammering when speaking. These changes in behavior have made me question whether something is wrong with me.\n\nMoreover, I've been experiencing intrusive thoughts and paranoia. I often find myself worrying excessively about being watched or judged by others, to the point where I take precautions like covering myself with a towel in the bathroom or feeling the need to express defiance towards potential surveillance. These thoughts and behaviors have been distressing and consuming, leading me to question my sanity and safety.\n\nI'm really hoping to get some help with all of this. I want to feel better and learn how to manage my symptoms and challenges in a healthy way.\n\n\nIf anyone has been through similar experiences or has suggestions for coping strategies or resources that could help me, I would greatly appreciate it. Can you provide guidance on what steps I can take to start feeling better and managing my mental health effectively on my own? I'm committed to making positive changes in my life, and any advice would be invaluable.",

        "body": "It's hard for me to put what I feel into words, so anything I write here might not truly reflect what I am feeling inside. My depression began long ago but different factors along the course of my life have either helped me get better or get worse. It began with school bullying as far back as elementary school, now I am a 27 year old who doesn't even remember what \"mental stability\" feels like. I could go on and on about my mental break downs in school or earlier in my life, but I feel like those don't matter anymore, maybe they do, but it's not what's on my mind right now. What's on my mind is that my life is just pure BS. I have this goal set for myself, but no matter how much I try to reach for it, I feel like it just gets farther and farther. Me and my gf both have the same goals, but she's closer to it than I am, but I feel like my approach to fulfill my goal is only drifting us apart. She comes from a wealthier family than I do, so for most of my relationship I have had to do more work, I am working 2 jobs as well as finishing up my university studies which has driven me insane, I get less than 5 hours of sleep daily, I barely have a social life at all, I can't remember what fun feels like, plus my job, despite being a job I like, has become so draining and hard that I am second guessing my career choice. This is actually my second career choice, I pursued my first one and realized I didn't like it at all, so I went in debt to pay off a study I didn't like and therefore spent 5 years of paying off student loans for nothing (I do not live in USA so University is cheaper here). I have become insanely forgetful, so much so that it is affecting my jobs, relationship and daily life in general, which only adds to my depression, self-hate, and personal image of myself. I try to calm myself by eating, I've even picked up smoking again (something I had stopped doing a few years ago), indulge in heavy caffeine drinking such as multiple cups of coffee and tea. I'm sorry, I know I am not helping myself with this, but I feel it's what brings me momentary relief, I sleep late because of work and university as well as I try to do something I like with the little time I have like watch a movie or play some video games, it helps calm myself, but by doing this I end up sacrificing time I could spend sleeping and therefore only get a few hours of sleep. I know my post is poorly organized, I am bad at wording things out. I can't afford a therapist right now, nor do I have much time either, as I am typing this I should be sleeping since I have to go to work in about 6 hours as of typing this and I am so sad to say that I am not looking forward to it. I could quit my job, but then I would be even farther away from my goal than ever before. No matter what I do, mental stability has become something of legend for me, and stress and depression has become the norm.",

I don't like doing things I once loved or doing anything really. I've considered ending it a few times but could never go through with it. I'm barely going to school and passing all my classes but gym which I've only attended 6ish times and its already 2 months into 2nd semester. the only thing making me pass my other classes is doing the homework but gym mark is heavily marked on attendance so I'll probably fail. no one knows I'm depressed aside from my friend whos going through the same thing and now goes too another school. all my bestfriends and friends at school are judgy and would tell other people no matter how much i love them it's the truth and they don't know why I barely go to school and are always mad at me for it and I've caught them talking behind my back and saying things like at least I'll graduate and go to college etc. My mom doesn't believe in depression and says it's all a scam to sell pills and wouldn't even believe I had anxiety and said I'm just trying to copy my older sister for attention and it's all a phone problem. I'm so young I shouldn't have to worry and feel this way. should I tell someone at school like a teacher? I'm worried they would tell my mom. ",

I don't have any. no close friends no close family no partner. I see people falling in love on TV and telling each other things. I can't do that. I have too many walls. nobody can know me. I feel alone. unmissable. but no suicide for me haha. I'm not that crazy. I'm just writing about how much I wish I was gone on a Tuesday at 9pm. I'm not crazy. I've thought about self harm, it doesn't appeal to me. I don't get it. pain makes me feel something. I feel like nothing. nothing is nice. nobody cares about nothing. people care about something. something can't stay in bed all day. something has to shower and do stuff. I don't want to be something. I want to be nothing. fade away into black. feel the earth swallow me whole. at least then I'll be held. I feel cold. the draft in my room moving the hairs on my arm. the black doesn't look cold. it looks warm, like a bed. not one with a million pillows to throw off. one that has just one big soft thick blanket you can lose yourself under. I want to be smothered by that blanket. I think I'm done here, but I don't feel done. I just want to feel like a whole, or to be nothing. ones easier than the other. maybe nothing is the better option. nothing is waiting for me. I can be myself with nothing. because I am nothing. worthless. and I'll always be that way. if I go to therapy and get healthy I'll still be me. I'll always be me. completely useless, inside and out. if I'm going to be useless I might as well be nothing. at least then I won't be the random piece of broken plastic in someones junk drawer. if I had to call myself an object it'd be that. nothing to be desired, just there. just something that's not even worth the time to throw it out. just sitting stuck forever. and that's the end of it. curtains closed. when I will lay on my death bed, I will be the same as I am now, so why wait.\"",

        "body": "Hey everyone I just wanted to share my bullying story and how it sometimes still affects me to this day. I will start off with my personality in school, I was very shy and quiet, which instantly made me a target. Basically in year 8 I was hanging around with this group of boys and girls, a lot of them would date each other and then I was left on the outskirts, constantly being excluded. They would constantly ask me questions like why are you so quiet in a mocking tone, which used to infuriate me. I used to walk around school on my own and leave school crying because I felt so isolated. I was also dealing with my sexuality back then so i felt further isolated. These group of girls which I considered my friends actually assaulted me once, by nearly blinding me, and because I was so embarrassed I did not tell anyone at the time. I fell into depression at the time.\n\nThey would make fun of the way I talked, walked, and used to cyber bully me too by calling me mocking nicknames, e.g. my contact name saved in their phone. At one point I was actually scared to go to school, because they would spam my phone with horrible messages. In Year 11 I got a new set of friends and they used to lock those friends in classrooms, and my school, the toxic hell that it was, never did anything about it. Anyway, I graduated high school, got a 2:1 in my degree and I am doing well sporting wise. I was so filled with anger at the time, and honestly I wish them all the worst in their lives. That feeling of exclusion and being ostracized, I can still feel to this day. It makes it hard for me to trust people. However, to everyone currently being bullied, just remember that revenge is the best success. They won\u2019t be able to stand how they treated you back then.\n",

Every day, I delved into learning something new and self-improvement. And now, how did it all end? I'm graduating from university, majoring in computer science. I don't know what to do with my life because beginner developers are not particularly needed in my country. War has taken away people close to me, and for over a year, I haven't been able to find a job to afford even the basics, and it's only getting worse with time. I can't leave the country because I'm eligible for conscription, and they might send me to war after my education. All of this has built up and hit me all at once one day. What's the point of continuing to live when I have no prospects in life? My entire life has been suffering for many years. I want to see the world, find a girlfriend, earn money, and afford to be happy, instead of dying in poverty or living on the brink of survival until the end of my days. I don't understand what I did wrong in life, why I deserve all this. Was I not supposed to be happy from the start? Is my fate to suffer? I'm really tired. I'm writing this post just before 100 rockets are launched. How I wish one of them would hit me because I'm too cowardly to end my own suffering.",

        "body": "Rant\nSo I started self harming back in December. I started with burning my feet, I quickly realized I enjoyed not just the pain but the after effects too. I liked having my feet bandaged, not because it was comfortable or got me attention or anything, but I think the little tingles of pain I got throughout the day. I also liked seeing the scars once it was healed, I\u2019m not sure why. I soon switch to cutting my arms, not deep as I don\u2019t want to cause permanent damage, but I do have some faint scars. At first I liked the scars, but the more I look at them and the more they fade away, the more I feel like shit, like I can\u2019t even cut myself right especially since I can\u2019t get it to bleed. This got a little worse when I went to the hospital (completely unrelated) and none of the doctors, nurses or even my family noticed anything wrong with my arm! Again not that I want them to see the scares. But am I really that bad at everything that I can\u2019t even cut myself correctly? \n\nToday I had to do it again, and got PISSED because cutting no longer felt right. I made one very small cut before I got so mad I had to stop. I didn\u2019t want to go back to burning, so I tried some alternative my therapist told me about, first I held ice cubes to my arm ( the one I cut) I hated it because the water running down my arm made me think of the blood I WANT to see but can\u2019t! The burn after felt kinda good tho. \nThe second one I tried was putting a hair tie on my wrist, pulling it taught and releasing it so it hits my wrist. I did this over and over again till my arm was sore and red. It felt good and made me feel better but\u2026 \nThere was no blood, no scars , no cuts NOTHING ! Just red skin for a few minutes \n\nI\u2019m pissed, I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. \n",

I feel like my problem is so stupid compared to the posts I see here, but I HAVE to understand, precisely because of those posts\u2026 for someone I love dearly. I have to try something. There has to be something I can do, right?\n\nRecently, my wife had an \u201cepisode\u201d, where I was there and everything was great. We were conversing, while she was working on her laptop (works from home), me playing with the kiddos and getting ready for daycare. When I get to work I text her mundane things about my dissatisfaction in regard to the happenings at my job.. she responds and says she can\u2019t at the moment, says she\u2019s crying and depressed. I go through the whole spiel of why, was it something I did, something at work, what can I do, etc.? Nothing I can do :(. She\u2019s ok now, she attributes it to her forgetting to take her depression meds. Is it as simple as that? She\u2019s had to increase her dosage a couple times now.\n\nAs I\u2019ve said, I won\u2019t pretend to act like I know the inner workings of depression. I don\u2019t know what to think. Or do, as a matter of fact. Is there anything I can do? I just feel so powerless and heart broken because she\u2019s there and I can\u2019t be there with her. ",

        "title": "I have to restart my entire 2nd year of uni and I haven't told my parents",
        "body": "Basically, I (M20) had a mental breakdown this year which has caused me to miss almost all of my lectures and deadlines this past term. I've been struggling with my mental health since I was 10, and this isn't the first time something like this has happened to me. During lockdown I was in my Junior year of high school was the worst--from February to spring break I couldn't do any homework and starting doing poorly on tests because of it. It wasn't that the work was too difficult or that I didn't like it; I've always loved school and learning, but I would procrastinate so badly that I missed deadlines, and I would get so anxious staring at the blank computer screen that I would have panic attacks. I started self-harming to try and force myself to do my work, but that obviously didn't help. Eventually, I told my parents what had been happening and they were very understanding. They created a plan with me, and I was shockingly able to finish all of my late work, and with partial credit I actually managed to get all my A's back.\n\nDespite my repeated troubles I had pretty good grades overall, and I was able to get into a good university in London, which I was quite happy about since UK undergrad degrees tend to be 3 years instead of 4, and I wanted to get to grad school as quickly as possible so I could eventually be a professor. Also, despite the higher rates for international tuition, it was still less expensive than instate tuition at my second choice. My parents decided to use most of our saved funds for college for me, mostly because my older sister had been able to pay for her own tuition by going to community college and working while living at home. My younger sister still has quite some time before she gets to college, and my dad started making a lot more money a few years back, so they'll probably have enough money for her depending on where she wants to go. Still, they did use a lot of money for me, about 30k per year and they also helped with housing significantly (London rent isn't cheap!)\n\nThere were some delays in getting my visa, which forced me to fly to London alone (first time away from North America!) and I was terrified. Well, I wasn't scared until the plane landed, since then I realized it was a lot more difficult to figure out a foreign transportation system than I had anticipated. That year was very difficult for me. I was too scared to leave my room most of the time, and it took me a very long time to befriend my flat-mates. I was just so scared of everything and everyone, in a way that I never had experienced before. Still, I was doing fine academically, and I eventually got involved in societies and made some friends. However, I still had bouts of depression, and often got assignments started the day they were due. At the end of the year, I actually missed an assignment because of this, and I had to retake it over the summer for the minimum possible marks. If you aren't familiar with the UK education system, at uni you usually only have a handful assignments or exams per course, and little to no homework or formative work. It should have been easy compared to the workloads I was used to, but for some reason it was so much harder when I had so little to do.\n\nI thought this year would be better; it would be a fresh start; I already had friends and I was much more confident than my first year. However, I still had issues getting to class and doing my work. Especially nearing the end of term 1 I missed several lectures and I was beginning to freak out. When I got back for term 2 I fell hard into depression within a week, being unable to leave my flat for days, even for food. Most of my term 1 deadlines were in January and I missed all of them. I missed the vast majority of my term 2 lectures and I became quite suicidal. The whole time, however, I tried to keep up with society responsibilities, as I knew if I didn't have friends around I wouldn't last. This just made me feel like a hypocrite--if I can do so much work for other people, why can't I show up to class? But at that point it felt impossible, I was so scared of going after having missed so much. Worst of all, I ended up ghosting my best friend from the US because I was too anxious to respond to a serious message he sent me in January. I responded to him a few days ago apologizing and explaining where I'd been, but he still hasn't answered. I think I may have ended that friendship permanently because of my stupid fucking anxiety.\n\nI convinced myself I would watch the lecture recordings and do my assignments and answer my texts and phone calls, but everything kept slipping past me, and I felt helpless. I even tried self-harming again, which--surprise, surprise--didn't work again. I eventually reached out for help when my department sent me an email asking where I've been. Now they're telling me I'm likely going to have to take an interruption of studies. I'll have to redo all of my term 1 assignments and retake all of my term 2 courses next year. I'll be a year behind my peers, my friends, and my plans for myself. I'll have to pay half a year of extra tuition. I'll have to reapply for my visa, and I might have to leave the UK until January, even though my lease doesn't end until September. I auditioned for a musical that's being put on by my friend's production company in London over the summer. I had plans to reach out to my professors to be a research assistant this summer as well. I'll have to let down my friends, and I've already let down my family.\n\nNow I have to tell them what happened before I fly back to the US for Easter break. They were understanding when I was in high school, but I'm an adult now. I chose to go to school in a different country. I chose not to reach out for help when I knew I needed it. I went to therapy for the first time over the summer, but I ghosted my therapist when they reached out for online sessions in the fall. I ran out of my new meds, but I felt like they didn't work so I never got a refill. What makes me feel worse about this all is that my younger sister had to go to inpatient over the fall due to her mental health issues, and she's had to spend the second half of 8th grade being homeschooled. She really looks up to me, and I don't want her to see me like this. She has her own problems, and my parents should only have to worry about her. It's a lot on all of their plates, and now I'm going to add to it significantly. How do I tell my friends, my family, my judgmental extended family, that I'm gonna take a year longer than I said I would? Would I even survive in grad school if I can't handle undergrad? Not to mention attempting a career in academia--it just seems like a foolish pipe-dream now.\n\nI'm so scared of telling everyone, I just wish I could start the year over without actually starting over. I wish I didn't have depression so I could just get out of bed when I feel bad. I wish things could just be easy. I am feeling better now, from a mental health perspective, but the shame is still enormous and inescapable. Sorry this post was so long, I've just had a lot on my mind for months now and I haven't been able to share it with anyone. I made a reddit account specifically for this, lol.\n\nTL;DR - I skipped all my lectures and missed my deadlines due to depression so now I have to retake my classes, delaying my graduation by a year, and now I have to tell my family I failed.",

        "body": "Hi there. Made this account 5 minutes ago. I'm a 28 year old male from the US. I've seen some of the posts on this subreddit used as a way of just getting users' thoughts out into the world, and that's what I want to do because I can't afford therapy lol. \n\nI've never been diagnosed with depression, or anything as much as the occasional strep throat. I have struggled with negative feelings though, about myself mostly, but also about the people around me. My home life growing up wasn't a happy one. My siblings and I suffered a lot of psychological abuse from my dad for a long time. We would get yelled at, interrogated, insulted, etc. over the smallest things, often to the point of tears. When my brother or I cried, our dad would feminize our names (e.g. a name like Joseph would become Josephine.) \n\nI bring this up because I coped badly with my home life for a long time. I learned that the best way to avoid punishment was to avoid my family altogether as much as possible. I would go outside or hide in my room whenever my dad was home. I would still do dumb kid/teenager shit, but I got really good at keeping it from my parents. There was never really a time I felt that I could ask for advice or ask for help. I developed a kind of independence that I was proud of for a long time, even though I fucked up a lot, and I had to learn a lot of things the hard way. In my mind, relying on someone gave them the power to hurt me, so if I couldn't get it myself, I didn't want it. I actually refused to accept tuition money from my dad because I felt like taking the money would be giving him power over me.\n\nOver time, that pride in my independence started to falter, and it started to feel less like a choice and more like I wasn't actually capable of being open or vulnerable with anyone. When I screwed anything up, no matter how small, I'd rip into myself relentlessly. I couldn't bring myself to start a relationship. I only pursued casual sex with co workers or women I met out with friends. Even my friendships started to feel fake, like everyone close to me was an acquaintance. I carried a lot of hurt, and I felt that I had to carry it alone or risk alienating myself. I felt alone and defeated, often hopeless. Being happy or lovable felt like a pipe dream. Much of this still applies today, though I'm in a better place than I was in a few years ago. \n\nAs of now, I'm in a weird transition phase. I realize that I need to be more open with people close to me, but it's very difficult. I don't want to be seen as weak or incapable, and I dont want to change the nature of my current relationships. Being 28 also, it feels as though I should have this figured out by now. On the bright side, I can accept now that I'll fuck up, and I have to forgive myself and keep moving forward. I want to be a better person and I want people to know me, even if it means letting them know where my weaknesses are.\n\nIt's mentally exhausting sometimes, but I'm taking it a day at a time now, and I'm learning how to be patient with myself. I'm pursuing a relationship now with the mindset that I deserve to love and be loved, without bringing any baggage from my past into it. I've also been hitting those weights baby! \ud83d\udcaa It's cliche, but I cant tell you how helpful that's been. \n\nI never talk about these things to anyone, so if you read this whole thing, I appreciate you. This was mainly just to say something I've never been able to say before, and even finishing this off, I feel relieved just to have put it out there. If anyone is going through something similar, I hope we both see better days. ",

I don't feel the motivation to workout, constantly wasting time and procrastinating. Not getting a job soon enough I will be in very very big trouble. Have an expensive mortgage.

Can't walk out of the relationship and set my wife free, I love my daughter too much. I do everything in the house, that I can, but I can't think intelligently or plan finances. I am poor with it.  I am sick and tired of being the stupid person who cannot make one smart decision. I know that I cannot. I just end up procrastinating and idling away time. Such a fk up!

        "body": "I came to the realization that I didn\u2019t want to let my potential rot in food service forever. So,  I decided to apply for what is deemed as \u201creal\u201d jobs. However, I was always insecure about my intelligence. I barely made it through grade school, and for as long as I can remember I have always struggled with cognition. I got bullied by teachers and my peers because of how behind I was academically and just because of how \u201cslow\u201d I was. Even still,  I got passed and went through each grade barely scraping by. I Knew something was wrong and desperately wanted help, but my parents refused to accept I was dumb so today I suffer with critical thinking, learning, articulation, comprehension, you name it, if it\u2019s academic or involves using my brain I struggle. I can barely hold conversations, and half of the time I\u2019m confused in them because I can\u2019t keep up with what\u2019s being said. Since I don\u2019t do well socially I don\u2019t have any friends and only really talk to my grandma and my boyfriend. Anyways, because of my incompetence, I limited myself to bussing jobs and warehouse work. I was a waitress also for 6-7 months but quit because I couldn\u2019t handle the stress and the amount of talking you have to do. Then one day, after working an 11 hr shift at a shitty conveince store, I broke down and thought maybe I\u2019m more capable than I thought and that I should give myself a chance. I applied for administrative assistant, receptionist and office assistant positions. About a couple of weeks later I landed a job as an office assistant for a small company. I\u2019m currently on my third week and my boss seems so regretful of hiring me. It\u2019s taking me a while to learn the main software we use, and I can\u2019t do basic math so I have to have a calculator at all times or I\u2019ll be sitting there for hours trying to figure out a simple calculation. They\u2019re seeming increasingly irritated by me and it made me cry in the office today, because I really don\u2019t want them to see me as I see myself. I also have issues with communication. I\u2019ll try to explain something about an invoice or bill and it just sounds sporadic, especially when I\u2019m nervous. I feel like my IQ is like 75 or something. I still barely how to punctuate this post and construct this it in a way that flows and makes sense. I just don\u2019t know what to do and I desperately need guidance. Should I just quit this job to avoid anyone wasting their time and resources on me? Maybe go back to easier jobs that don\u2019t overwhelm me and give me panics? Or should I stick it out and wait until they fire me? It\u2019s so draining humiliating myself everyday because I don\u2019t know basic information I should by my age, makes me look like a joke. Maybe this discomfort is normal adult stuff but I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m 21, almost 22 so I\u2019m an adult but also not really. ",

        "body": "Though I had been wrestling with mental health on and off for the last several years, it became apparent to me about one year ago that I was actually also depressed. My wife knew as much or suspected as much, but I really didn\u2019t realize it until nearly a year ago to the day.\n\nI faced with an exciting long weekend trip planned. It was supposed to be exciting at least. The day of I became extremely scared and anxious. I felt like almost at once I lost interest in the event I had been looking forward to all year long. I couldn\u2019t get out of bed and I started crying.\n\nIt was at that point I finally understood what people who described depression meant. It finally hit me. I scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist, got sober, and started to really focus on my wellbeing.\n\nA year later and I feel like I can feel the anxiety creeping up. I hate it. I hate focusing more on missing my wife, dogs, home, etc and not on the fun long weekend plans I have. My wife tells me I should be telling my psychiatrist I need something for immediate relief like Xanax but I\u2019m pretty sure I can\u2019t just demand that of my doctor. I also can\u2019t help but feel like even though that kind of thing might get me over the hump that it\u2019s just a bandaid for a bigger problem.\n\nSo I just wanted to vent about this. The onus for me really taking this seriously was the fact I missed the same event this time last year and I was devastated I sabotaged myself by not taking care of myself. I feel like things are going much better but despite that I can feel my fears creeping up. Maybe that\u2019s just a part of getting older or something else entirely. I\u2019d just like to think that a year of Prozac and Wellbutrin would help me to be happier and not focus so much on my anxieties.",

So I decided to give life one last chance and take no bullshit from anyone including myself (that's a different story but none of this has happened and I'm far more miserable than I was before, college is insanely stressful, my hair has been falling out, and I think I scratch my head in my sleep since I regularly wake up with my pillow covered in blood which is new for me). I moved across the country and started studying animal behaviour. I am generally a very polite person, I care deeply about people around me, and I would jump in front of a bus to save a stranger, yet it seems nobody around me cares how caring or insightful or interesting of a person I can be? Every friend I have made constantly treats me as an after thought, I've never once in my life been invited to do something outside of school with anyone, or really in school. It's not like I'm not talkative either, and I would say I'm pretty funny, but since every friend I've had in my life has ditched me, or screwed me over, or shit talked me behind my back. I can count on one hand the number of people that have stayed around through my anxiety and depressive attacks, and due to their circumstances they aren't around much. I've noticed I've started to become spiteful, which I think is fair enough. Every time I look around and see people laughing with their friends I get so upset, why do those people deserve to be happy but I deserve to live in constant misery by myself??? And sometimes I think quite violently because of this and that's pretty upsetting to me. Obviously I would never act on any of this, and I would rather self sacrifice even for people who don't give a fuck about me, but it hurts so much to do that and it's such a lonely existence and I just don't understand what keeps leading me to this situation. Why am I always an afterthought? \n\nThe first time I seriously hurt myself, I had been planning my birthday for months with my friends at the time, we were gonna go camping, get drunk and smoke, listen to music, watch films and all the usual stuff. They all cancelled on me the literally day of the event, I had already packed my things to go. I broke into our alcohol cupboard and drank 2 bottles of vodka and watched a Michael Myers movie alone at 4 AM. I started thinking and I seriously couldn't handle being alive and I slammed my head into my wall over and over until my tears and a small patch of blood stained it.\n\nWhy can't I just be one of those people at the bar right now, not a thought in their head, dancing, having drinks and laughing with their friends. It just feels so unfair, why can't I be born as someone else?\n\nI feel infinitely more alone in a crowded room than an empty one since at least the silence doesn't bite. \n\nThanks for listening to my rant :)\nMuch love",

I would get beat up by two brothers. One was a year older and one was a year younger than me. \nIt wasn\u2019t horrible. My parents never even noticed.\n\nWhen I started school I would still cry in the morning, no longer every day but still often. When I reached 3rd grade I started resisting to go to school.\nMy mom would drag me to the car by the collar of my jacket cause I was staying home one or two days a week and she was fed up.\n\nBy the 4th grade I lost all my friends. My teachers thought it would be good to put me in a different class where I didn\u2019t have the only people I weren\u2019t scared to talk to.\nNow that im thinking back it would probably not have been so hard to make friends, at an age like that it\u2019s easy, but at the time I couldn\u2019t. \nI kept staying home a lot.\n\nFrom the 4th-6th I started getting teased for my hair and clothes. I had everything from red and black split dye to purple hair with white stripes. My clothes were always 3 Sizes too big, I would rather be teased for my clothes than my body.\n\nI always hated the way I looked, Even before people started calling me ugly. My skin was to dark, my legs were to skinny, my stomach was to big, I didn\u2019t like how I didn\u2019t have breast. I planned how I could cut off my fat with minimal scarring\nI was only 4.\n\nIt only got worse as I got older. Now I was thinking about every tiny feature. But this is also not enough to be depressed.\nEveryone is insecure\n\nIn 6th-7th grade I was picked on for how I looked. From peers, strangers, relatives, even friends. \nBut it wasn\u2019t awful. Not like the stories I can see on the internet. My life is easy, so why am i like this.\n\n8th grade. I couldn\u2019t leave the house without insane nausea from anexiety. I went to school for 2 days before I broke down in the bathroom. I never went after that, Im starting collage and I haven\u2019t even gone to school\none\nsingle\nday.\n\nI am throwing away my \u201cbest\u201d years because im \u201cdepressed\u201d when I have no reason to be. I never attempted or anything like that. Never wanted to either. I don\u2019t want to live this way, But I want to live.\n\nSometimes I wish my childhood was worse. Maybe that my parents were divorced, or that they neglected me instead of being helicopter parents. Not to feel pain, not cause I want it or think it\u2019s cool, I just wish I had an actual excuse to spend all day in bed and feel like shit.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be cheered up or anything, I just need to know if there is anyone else that feels like this for absolutely no reason at all.",

I got diagnosed with diabetics a week into the new term at school, and because I had been putting off the doctors visit for months I had gotten quite ill, I had eaten all my muscle and couldn\u2019t stay awake or active for very long, this led to me missing 4 months of school. I take 4 highers and have been mainly focusing on history and English as I want to become a history teacher. Yesterday my school had a meeting m, they have changed the way advanced highers work and now to get into ah history I need to Apply, get a A or B in higher history and I need to pass another 3 highers to even be considered, and even if I\u2019m accepted it\u2019s a virtual course, I\u2019m bringing this up because it apply to what has cause the spiral. I realised that I can\u2019t do it, I won\u2019t be able to pass all my highers and I won\u2019t do well in a virtual class. I have no other choice but to pass them but I\u2019m definitely not going to. This has caused me to cry every single hour I\u2019m awake and even right now. I can\u2019t do this and I\u2019ve already had mental health issues in the past while I definitely had them hiding under the surface until now. The therapist at my school is for lack of a better word a snitch, she tells guidence everything and will even call home when the form you fill out says she won\u2019t, so I can\u2019t talk to her, I also can\u2019t get a therapist outside of school because I just don\u2019t have the money. I can feel myself slipping back into the wake up and just be a husk of myself til I\u2019m home to cry phase and I know I can\u2019t do that again. Please if anyone has any idea what would make me feel better or feel more human, he\u2019ll even anything that could help my in school I would be grateful.",

Because of this I feel like I\u2019m underdeveloped and smaller than all the other guys because I\u2019ve been unable to get out and be active to do things like going to the gym or playing a sport like everyone else seems to do. I\u2019m not part of something like everyone else, I don\u2019t have many friends at all and the only reason I haven\u2019t taken my own life yet is because of my long distance girlfriend who means a lot to me. \n\nThings have taken a turn for the worse recently because of this guy with the same name as me. I\u2019m already under the impression that every guy is bigger, stronger, more successful and happier than me and I\u2019ve yet to be proven wrong, but this guy in particular is everything I\u2019ve ever wanted to be. He\u2019s so cool and I fucking hate him. I overhear him a lot in my classes. He wants to be a filmmaker like me but he already gets client work and makes a lot of money from it. He goes to the gym and has gained a lot of muscle mass. He looks much bigger and stronger than me so he has more confidence and looks better in his clothes. He looks way more attractive than me. He plays music better than me. He\u2019s funnier than me. He\u2019s way more social and has way more friends. His girlfriend isn\u2019t long distance. He got a tattoo recently, I\u2019ve always wanted a tattoo. I don\u2019t even want to smoke cigarettes but it\u2019s so cool when he does it. He\u2019s so much better than me in every single way, it makes me wonder why I even fucking bother. I wish I was dead so I don\u2019t have to feel inferior to everyone anymore. It hurts. \n\nI know that I could change myself and go to the gym or do what i wanted but it\u2019s so hard for me. I feel exhausted all the time. Therapy doesn\u2019t work. My meds hardly work. I\u2019m just this pathetic worthless loser who would rather complain than actually do anything. I hate myself so much and I\u2019d do literally anything to be like him. ",

        "body": "(30M) \nI must admit, I'm not so great at this life malarkey. Feel like I'm not 100% living most of the time, not that that makes any sense but it's difficult to put into words. \n\nSo, I didn't have the best of upbringing. Parents separated when I was 10 in an incredibly unpleasant way. Quickly after that my Mom was in a relationship with now my step-father. I heard lots about my Mom and Father's breakup through the mouth of my step-father about what my father used to do to my mother, so on and so fourth.  I'm not going to go into detail as it still enrages me to this day, still very raw deep down - I believe this is where my troubles started. \nA year or 2 after that - probably much less but what felt like an eternity I started taking severe punishments for things I don't remember from my step-father. Beatings, a broken bone here and there, bruises, stopped from being outside with my friends. Until a relative saved me and pretty much saved my life. (In my eyes). \nI have alot of great memories from living with my relative. In fact, I dont remember a bad memory. But one thing I did miss out on was growing up with and being around my siblings. I did fear for them even at such a young age. Things from the past started troubling me at high school, getting me into trouble and even kicked out of school - but I couldn't speak. I couldn't open up to a single soul. I've never been great with words just the same as I've never been great with living with my own mind. \n\nFast forward to 2019/early 2020. The global pandemic. I was a key worker through the pandemic. Going home to my 2 beautiful children and my soul mate after extremely long hours on the job. Not wanting to go home so I could protect my children but never wanting to leave their sides at the same time, a strange feeling that I'm sure many of us had during the many months of the Coronavirus lockdowns. I would cross paths with my partner when working during these times, I'd come home and she'd be off to do her own work working nights on the frontline during the pandemic. At the end of 2020 I took a month off work due to a significant flare up of my mental health, one I hadn't had before. I couldn't bare to continue with my life, I kept this quiet from everyone around me apart from my workplace. \nI went back to work 4 or 5 weeks afterwards, not 100% and quite low , still under the same rules and presures of day to day life under something so strange. After another month or 2 I began to keep waking up during the nights with an awful sense of fear, that \"gut instinct\" kind of feeling. \nI later found out that my partner was cheating on me after 14 years together. She quickly ended the relationship and things really went south with my mental health aswell as our relationship. Lots of horrible things happened as if I'd been some kind of devil, awful accusations ect. I continued to struggle on at work for a couple of weeks when things became incredibly unbearable in what felt like the click of the fingers - I didn't want to live anymore and that i would end my life after this very shift. This feeling was incredibly strange looking back to it now, it was like I had no more worries. As if every single thing that I had been carrying for a huge amount of my life had just been lifted off my shoulders. I left work feeling incredibly low but at the same time rather calm and collected about my decision. I drove about 40 miles to a secluded location and had a cry to my favourite songs, stroked the cheeks of my children on the screen on my phone and that was it, I swallowed 2  bottles of pills, 1 bottle of pills being my antidepressants and half a bottle of co-codamol. I wasn't upset anymore, I was more angry about my short life. I remember going lightheaded and after that I don't remember anything other than waking up in hospital remembering what I came back to, it upsets me still. \n\nI'm still struggling to this day with these feelings of betrayal. Remembering everything like it was yesterday. I have became incredibly jealous because I feel as If I'm not good enough, not good looking enough,  Don't do enough and whatever else. \n\nI'm not suicidal but feeling like the end of life could he close and could save me from my tormented mind. \n\nI have tried speaking with councillors and doctor and whoever else, I was told from a councillor that \"you're not depressed, you just need to get up and carry on\". I get that, I do need to but how. How do I pick myself up from alot of torment and trauma. \n\nThank you for being ears and eyes. As I said, I'm not so good with words. I'm sorry if some things don't make sense. ",

Over the course of my life (23F), I\u2019ve dealt with physical abuse, sexual abuse/assault, verbal abuse and emotional abuse. I find it really difficult to connect to people because I feel like other people just don\u2019t understand. I was married at 19, got pregnant shortly after and my ex-husband turned into a raging and abusive alcoholic. I left him 3 years ago. A little over a year ago, I shot myself in the chest. There\u2019s no way I should be alive right now. In fact, I did die for a brief period. Yes, I was getting help and on medication. I wanted to get better. But I guess at some point, I couldn\u2019t go on feeling the way I felt anymore. I couldn\u2019t sleep, couldn\u2019t eat, and was always trapped inside my head. After all of this, my ex-husband tried to take my daughter away from me and filed a restraining order. No, she wasn\u2019t with me when I shot myself and I never put her in harms way. Fast forward, I have 50/50 custody of her. I met the man of my dreams about a year ago and we are planning on getting married, but he just got two year orders in the Middle East. Now I feel like I\u2019m back to square one. The one person who made me feel alive again is 7400 miles away and I\u2019m alone at home when my daughter isn\u2019t here and it\u2019s quiet. Too quiet.

        "body": "I\u2019m 18f and a senior in high school. I\u2019ve been struggling with mental illnesses for most of my life. I think it started when my mom had schizophrenia and was an alcoholic, and the things she did to me traumatized me. From there I had anxiety, then a few years ago I had terrible religious OCD to the point I couldn\u2019t eat, sleep, piss, or leave the house. I would also bang my head over and over. After a while my OCD symptoms began to get a lot better. But then I found myself to be really depressed and I\u2019ve had to go to a mental hospital about 6 times. I used to be so good in school, so intelligent and I would win so many awards for different academic achievements. Now I\u2019m just behind, barely making it by. Watching everyone getting accepted in to amazing colleges and achieving so much in school makes me so jealous and angry and dreadful. My one goal in life was being successful in high school and college. When my mom died last January, things just progressively got worse and I can feel myself falling apart. And sometimes I find it actually unbelievable how many terrible things have happened back to back in my 18 years of being here. I hate that I\u2019m not doing well in school because other people have been through things too but they\u2019re still pushing themselves. Ive never felt so depressed in my life and I think about dying every day. I try to work myself up to do more productive or social things but it\u2019s like I can\u2019t control that terrible dread that\u2019s lingering at all times. It literally eats me up inside and makes me want to kill myself. I feel like I\u2019m going to end up just like my mom who tried so hard but just ended up killing herself. I really really need help I don\u2019t know what to do from here. I keep thinking of death all the time.\n\nI should probably mention I had moved out of my dad\u2019s house in December because it was a terrible environment. So now I just feel extra lonely.",

I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, CTPSD, ADHD and a while host of other stuff well into my 30s. I get it. Life can really fucking suck. Sometimes, there doesn't seem to be a way out. Except that one way. To be fair, I tried that way, too. \n\nI'm here to present an alternative way of looking at the constant state that is depression. I don't look at it as a stigma anymore, I look at it as a sign. A sign that things are odd and not right. If it's me, Ican sit down and evaluate me, and come up with a way to address it. If it's not, and sometimes, it isn't, I work my way through it until it's something I can do something about it. It's a companion at this point, something that's going to stick with me for the rest of my life. And that's OK. I'll have good days and bad days. But don't let depression steer you off the road too far. ",

I cannot work up the strength to start from 0 again. And I also just cannot think about any future in which I would be content with who I am. I just lost my will to fight for a future that will only find new ways to batter me down further and further. I have nothing to strive for, nothing to live for. I am burned out. There is no fuel left inside of me to keep me going anymore. I lost the grip on my existence. And I do not even care enough anymore to try and get it back.",

Big emotions that my parents shut down. \n\nJust the look of disappointment of my parent\u2019s face was enough to send me into a spiral of shame and guilt. \n\nMy parents had to basically force me to eat at times. \n \nI was too scared in 1st grade to tell my teacher I threw up. I barely spoke to anyone in school for years. \n\nI always cried at the drop of a hat. Especially if someone told me I was wrong after finally speaking up. \n\nI would sleep for 16 hours a night if my parents allowed me. \n\nNever had interests. Couldn\u2019t keep friends. \n\nI have always been utterly exhausted. Never been able to open up to people. \n\nI learned very young that I\u2019m not my own person. To sit down and shut up. To be seen, not heard. That I don\u2019t get an opinion. That I\u2019m not allowed to have wants and needs. \n\n\n\nI know shitty childhoods are so common but do people ever actually recover from never having been their own person in the first place? Never having separated and individuated from their parents? But at the same time their parents have never been a secure base? ",

It\u2019s been tough, we are long distance at the moment (he\u2019s moved back with his parents so he can get some support from them, and they live a few towns over from me), so we haven\u2019t seen each other in a while, but we talk often. We are totally exclusive, dating more than a year. \n\nLately, my friends have started calling him \u201cjust a friend\u201d, and diminishing the relationship because we haven\u2019t seen each other in a while. They\u2019re saying that we aren\u2019t together, it\u2019s not a \u201creal\u201d relationship, and I should move on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just bummed, I thought my friends were more supportive than that. I have had depression my entire life and I thought they weren\u2019t so judgemental about it\u2026. I understand that it\u2019s not a typical relationship right now/\u201con hold\u201d, but it\u2019s because he\u2019s got serious health issues! He\u2019s trying to survive everyday life right now. So dates go on the back burner for a bit.\n\nAre they dismissive because it\u2019s mental? If he had cancer and couldn\u2019t go on a date because of his treatments, nobody would judge me for sticking around\u2026. If one of my friend\u2019s husband went into a coma, I wouldn\u2019t ask them \u201chow\u2019s your FRIEND doing?\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s 2024, how are people still judging mental health this much??",

I will also disclose I started on topamax as well but there\u2019s not been enough time for it to kick in yet. Not sure if there\u2019s any difference yet. I know part of life is having bad days but today I am having those same feelings I had when I was severely depressed. I\u2019ve had stress at work but that\u2019s normal. My love and dating life is crap right now and I just had a big let down from someone. I get it, those are things everyone deal with but I\u2019m so scared of falling back into that phase and just wondered if maybe it\u2019s because my system has been disturbed by the dose increases or if my depression is creeping in again. Does anyone else have these feelings? Please no harsh comments. ",

I have so much outstanding work right now and even with an appointment attended on learning supports (procrastination and motivation based) a couple days ago, i have barely done anything of value. \n\nAlmost a month ago, i started really minor s/h, it affects my gf more than me, though. Except recently I\u2019ve been afraid of the urges. I scratch, but mu brain has been wanting to escalate. I don\u2019t enjoy the icky feeling those thoughts give me, but they\u2019re popping up throughout the last day or two\n\nBefore this last month or two, i may have thought there was no way i could be depressed, but I can\u2019t seem to pull myself out of this, and it\u2019s affecting my grade a lot. I plan on trying to get work done every day and then i dont. Day by day. For weeks now. All i want to do right now is go back to bed :( ",

        "body": "  \n(20F) 5 years ago I was diagnosed with Asperger's. At that time I didn't feel reflected and I didn't want to know anything about it, but after a lot of failures I realized that I am much less functional than I thought. I don't have any social instincts and even though I internalize the things I observe in the rest of the world, I don't quite understand them or feel them as my own. Everyday things like greeting (anyone) make me uncomfortable, it is difficult for me to manage my body language and I have to overthink even the smallest detail of what I do, even with my family and friends. I rarely feel on the same page with anyone and I have never been able to talk to more than 2 people at a time in my life. I don't know how to approach people at the faculty, I'm always alone, and I can only discuss things with my friends. (No one wants to do \"extroverted activities\" with me) I could improve my social skills a little since with practice things start to come a little more naturally to me but essentially I will always be like that.  \nIt feels a little like everyone is gaslighting me and my only way to roughly guess what to do is to think obsessively about how other people see me. I took antidepressants at the time to control anxiety attacks and my social functioning decreased significantly, to the point that my best friend stopped talking to me.  \nI don't want to dwell on how deficient I am, but believe me, it goes beyond my will. I always ran into the same problem and always repeated the same cycle of hope followed by disappointment. I find it almost unbearable to think about what I describe and rationally I feel almost absolute hopelessness. I feel that at least I won't be able to disappoint myself because it is impossible to get something worse than what I expect. Lately I have extreme emotional lability and it only bothers me because it makes it difficult for me to continue with my life, because beyond that my only interest right now is to draw up some guidelines so that my life is less unbearable.  \nPS: I hate math and I need to look normal in order to get a job above minimum wage. I write this in Google Translate.  \n",

        "body": "Hi all, I'm here for help because I'm honestly getting more and more suicidal and desperate and I feel trapped and don't know where to turn. Any advice on tackling this is appreciated. My boyfriend and I live in his mom's basement and have for about two years, ever since our house we previously lived in caught fire. We both struggle with depression and things have gotten really bad. I'm ashamed admitting all this, but the basement can't be walked through anymore without stepping on garbage and clothes. Our possessions are constantly getting ruined and broken in the clutter and our cats have peed on a ton of things. Just this morning a vase I made in high school that meant a lot to me shattered. There are pee bottles everywhere because my boyfriend often feels that's easier to do than going upstairs through everything to the bathroom. One half of the basement flooded a bit and it's wet and starting to mold the garbage and clothes. It will take at least a full week of effort to clean and that's if we don't work which isn't an option. This isn't one of those \"oh, just get rid of the garbage first, then get dishes out, then get laundry in the laundry room, then put all the things back in their place!\" situations (I say this because that's what all the articles online say, but we don't have places for things.) We have too many clothes for our single dresser, we're paycheck to paycheck right now since we're 26 and just put all our savings into starting a business with no funding eight months ago and work six days a week (often seven, business is going well, though, and it's the one thing I'm truly proud of) and only get 4 hours at home each day before bed, the kitchen sink upstairs can't simply get our dishes put in it because my boyfriend's mom struggles with depression too and has years of her own things built up in there, and there's just so much down here and up there TO clean that it feels totally impossible (plus she doesn't want us to touch her things). We only use disposable dishes now, and that makes me guilty too. We don't have many things that truly have a \"place\" in here. We've made breakthroughs on it before and gotten it about a quarter of the way done with the cleaning on several occasions, but our whole life is in a basement when we had a house full of things and everything piles up all the time and gets really overwhelming really quickly. We've been saving for a house but are at least a year from getting it. It's gotten to the point that the only place to exist is the bed, and it's all I can keep clean. The house as a whole, upstairs and in the basement, is disgusting, frankly. My boyfriend grew up like this, and I didn't - my family is full of clean freaks and I feel like I've failed all the time. There's not even a place I'm comfortable sitting in the whole house that's not the bed that we got about a year ago since it's genuinely the only thing I feel like won't get dirt or something on me by sitting on it. My boyfriend's mom has terrible paranoia issues and we could never get the house professionally cleaned as such - she won't even allow contractors in to fix things that could be dangerous to her, everything has to be an emergency before it's taken care of even if we want to pay for it. I know I'm going to need to chip away at things, I just don't know how to maintain motivation and not fall into another long spell in the process. Thanks to anyone who might be able to offer any advice, I appreciate it. ",

Even games that should\u2019ve been fun do nothing now. I can\u2019t remember the last time I felt happy. Even if I somehow won the lottery, I think I\u2019ll just be on the bed everyday and not try to do anything else.\n\nI lived most of my life with almost no social life. If not for school, I wouldn\u2019t have interacted with my peers. I did hang out with several of my classmates during college and in addition met a bunch of acquaintances. After we graduate, we all just gradually drifted apart.\n\nThe same thing happens now. Aside from work, I don\u2019t socialize. The thought about \u201cmaintaining\u201d a friend/relationship feels exhausting. To make it worse, I\u2019m having a really hard time trusting people. No surprise that no one tried to reach me.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m just wasting away at this point. Went to a psychiatrist that gave me meds but don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for long term.\n\nAny comments would be appreciated. If not, thank you for reading this :)\n\n\n",

I'm sorry for being alive honestly I'm shocked I'm still here. I love you all I swear you guys are the reason I made it this far. i just feel so drained I don't feel like I'm gonna make it in life, clearly I wasn't made for this world anyway. everyone hates me for no reason they turned me into this when I haven't done shit to them. fuck I wanna be the old me so bad even if I still went thru bad times when I was younger I didn't feel as bad as this. I feel like no one truly loves me except my family. I'm so fucking ugly omd. I love summer but I hate the short clothes that come with it and my eczema gets so much more worse I feel like nothing can help it. I hate my fucking hands.\n\nNote for mom (translate to romainian for her)\nmom I love you so much you've always treated me so well every time something went wrong you were always there to comfort me, even if sometimes we argue we always turn fine in the end. this is not your fault at all you've done your best to help me. I love you so much and nothing would ever change that. I hope you recover from this and succeed in life. I'm sorry I'm dead I know you tried your best to get me help and I know your going to go through hard times when u read this (when I'm dead) school and people are too much for me to handle. I love you so much\n\nNote to dad (translate)\n\nDad you were always there making jokes and making everyone laugh,I'm sorry I don't talk to you that much I really hope you can forgive me.

I'm so sorry one of your sisters is dead but I can't go on I've been trying for too long. you were such a big part of my life in the best way possible. thank you so much. I love you don't forget to stay strong make sure no one tells u nothing that make u feel down and If they do go sort them out because they are all insecure little bitches who are so bored with their life that they make someone else feel bad about their life because they just can't stand seeing someone happy, but honestly stay strong don't let this bring you down. i hope you succeed in life\n\nNote to sister\n\nYou were nothing but funny and calm, everytime I was mad or sad you would always make me feel better, youd always argue for me with no hesitation, like I wrote about isabella, don't let this bring you down, you guys have eachother and that should help, please don't let me bring you down stay strong and tell rude people to fuck off because they aren't worth your precious time.

I'm so glad your still here and you got the help you needed, even if you have some bad times it's just a natural part of life, shit happens but you just gotta make it through to prove all them people wrong. ilysm and thank you for being here, I swear I tried my best.\n\nnote to cats\n\nMEOW MEOWW MEOEW.

I don't wanna live. I failed at life and I barely started it. everyone keeps ignoring the signs that I'm truly not okay. please stop looking the other way. look at me, look at what you fucking turned me into. don't start talking about my attitude when u made me get one.

I don't wanna live. \n\n12/2/24 11:10\n\ni wanna kms so bad rn, it's getting worse I can't help myself, schools making me feel so depressed all my friends are leaving me out even if I try include myself, I don't feel like I belong here. they always ignore what I say and I have to go by myself everywhere and they don't wanna walk me to the toilet because apparently I'm too \"bossy\" but I don't think I am. they my only friends I have other then my fr friends aqsa and omaima. sometimes I can't find them though so I'm stuck by myself or with my other \"friends\" we used to be the best friend group but now they only care about radiyah. I clearly don't mean much to them anymore. I wanna hang myself so bad rn but I don't want to leave my family, they are the only ones who understand me. I don't want my mom to cry neither my sisters or my dad or anyone else, I'm trying for them. I'm gonna try win this battle I've been fighting for years. I wanna selfharm so hard but I can't because I don't wanna get caught. they thought I'm better and they probably think I'm just making jokes out of school and taking the Mick out of them but I'm trying, this school is filled with awful people that don't care a single bit about what your feeling as long as they get popular or attention, I've been trying to hold myself together forever but I've been getting worse in school. I want to have a future but part of me thinks I won't make it that far. What has happened to me. I just wanna be normal. I miss the girl I was before school. please help me Im so ugly. I wanna slit my throat open. there's no end to the pain bruh. it's gonna continue until I die. life can come with ups and downs but it's been down for too long. why am I still living. why am I not hanging myself right now. please. I'm so sorry if I ruined anyone's life, I'm just a bitch that ruins people lives. I feel so bad for being annoying.I'm sorry for being alive but imma think of changing that soon. Hopefully some day I just jump off a bridge. people at school keep insulting me yet they expect me to ignore it when I'm so sensitive? JUST FUCKING LISTEN TO ME. STOP MAKING EXCUSES FOR MY EMOTIONS ACTING LIKE THEIR YOURS!? fuck. school has drained me so fucking much and I just wanna slit my wrists and bleed out. people keep telling me these feelings are temporary but they feel like an eternity. i should of been murdered the day I was born. I didn't mean to be annoying or anything. everyone just ignoring that I'm obviously not okay.  my phone dry asf even when it's not on dnd mode.\nnobody ever understands me, please just kill me. I keep imagining myself dying soon anyway. I don't wanna hurt people. why do they always hurt me. I'm sorry for coming into your life, clearly I didn't belong there, I don't wanna see my mom cry or worry but I always end up making her worry. I'm such a bad child. my hearts so heavy\n\n26/2/24 12:19\n\nthe cycle starts again in a few hours, I don't want to do this anymore, my WiFi always gets cut off at 11 now and it's so annoying because I can't go sleep before 11 even if I try force myself or even relax myself, I'm just gonna be stuck in an endless loop of my thoughts and this note, schools making me so depressed right now. my bffs have their own bffs that obviously mean so much more to them, my friendgroup cares about radiyah more then me now even though she just joined it, so much for inviting her in because she was being left out of her other friend group. now I'm the one getting left out. our trio was perfect until she joined and made it four people. three people now. they replaced me, I feel so empty bro. all I do is start arguements for no reason man. I wanna kill myself but I don't want people to feel bad.I can't stop crying my heart hurts. 3 year friendship gone down for a 3 month friendship. I feel so unloved. I love too hard man, I don't feel like anyone understands me. I saved someone like me though, she's getting the help she needs now. she said that she couldn't of done it without me and that makes me feel better but I still feel like shit. damn people really hate me huh. I love my family so much, I think they love me too. I enjoy playing with Isabella but at night when she leaves the thoughts just come back. I think I have depression. I can't go a day without thinking of killing myself. there is no end to the pain.\nI hate school so much it's 6 hours of expericing hell. no one understands me there even though they all think they do. I wish someone understands me. is this world even real. the only thing getting me through life is music and my family. without them I woulda been dead rn. I keep trying to starve myself but I can't turn down food. I'm scared people won't like me because of my body and my hipdips. this world is shit. it's all gonna go down one day. I'm so happy our lives are temporary. people with perfect life's make me jealous.  why can't someone truly care for me. every night, every time I'm alone, every time it goes quiet, before I'm about to sleep all I can think about is ways to kill myself. I'm only 12. please stop my pain. I just want to have a fun happy life like the other people, I wanna be skinny,pretty, funny and all that. I feel so fucking ugly. I love my boyfriend even though I get obsessive over him he still calms me down and stays with me. he's someone other then my family that understands my feelings. I think he's the person that knows the most about my life.\n\n\n26/2/24 11:19\n\nI don't have anywhere to put my feelings except for this note. I don't think anyone understands how bad I've been getting. it's been like this for over 1 year, thinking about suicide everyday, selfharming, getting angry for no reason, I just want it to stop. I just wanna feel like a normal person. these teachers are making me feel like shit even when I'm trying my best. \"(name) what is this , this isn't enough\" clearly plastic surgery won't be enough for you. fuck. stop making me feel like this. I feel like a shadow everyone ignores. I lost all my friends. I hate my life, why does it have to be this hard. why can they have the perfect life and be happy after they destroyed mine. why aren't they getting karma. fucking dipshits. I just wanna cut myself untill I bleed out but it's not like I can because wtf am I gonna do if it doesn't work? go around walking looking like I'm some zebra? no thanks. fuck I just wanna kill myself. but I don't wanna leave my family behind me. they care about me so I don't know why I feel like this. I ordered stuff online for 10 quid so atleast I have something to look forward to. I barely made it through today, everyone's just messing about and talking to me like I'm some type of animal. I've done nothing wrong I don't understand why they keep doing this, they know how it makes me feel yet they keep fucking doing it. what are these heartless dogs doing in school \"this school will help you with bullying and mental health\" clearly fucking not because I'm getting bullied Infront of you and your choosing to ignore it. my eyes for school just fucking worsened I don't think I'm making it far in life. at this point not even music can help me get through lessons, I hate everyone here. please just stop hating me I don't know you. parents need to learn how to raise their children because clearly this world is going to shit.  I always end up setting a date for my death but I never go through with it because I'm such a pussy. I just wanna feel alive again. I fucking miss my old self when I didn't care how I looked, what people were saying to me. I just wanna escape this life.  no one will ever understand me even if they think they Do. no one knows me more then this note knows me. \"give me Ur phone\" \"no\" \"are u hiding something?\" yes this fucking note since everyone wanna be such a bitch to people who haven't even done shit. I just want someone to notice how unstable I am and not make fun of it. I miss how fresh cuts looked on my wrists but I can't do it  again because I'm in forced recovery. cutting my internet at 11pm isn't gonna do shit with me being late for school. it's my desire to die when I wake up making me late. \"Ur too young to feel like this it's just a phase\" clearly it fucking isn't because I've been in this phase for so long I feel like I'm never getting out.\n\n7/3/24 11:04pm\n\nI fucking hate school so much, I wouldn't wish this pain on anyone. all the teachers think they understand me and that I'm just a bad person but I swear I'm not. I'm not trying to be late or have an attitude i cant fucking help it. they texted my dad about how im being late too many times like wtf atleast I actually came to your lesson instead of not coming. \"wheres your homework\" idfk bro I was tryna kill myself the other night because of this shit hole. they all want me to do better but they don't understand that I'm trying. this world is so fucked up bro I feel so bad and stupid. I don't think I'm gonna make it far in life. I literally hate myself. I hate my thoughts. I hate my mind. why am I like this. I just wanna be happy please I've done nothing wrong. I wanna become the best version of me but obviously I can't. this life feels impossible. I already settled on my decision to kill myself soon. even if I don't want to I know its for the better to just leave my family alone, even if it will make them feel bad soon they will realise I was a problem. I walked home from school crying and atleast someone asked me if I was okay. this world is such a fucked up place. what did I do to deserve this. I seriously hate my life. I'm gonna kill myself but I just dont know when. no one understands me. their all fooled by the fake version of me that I put on. I'm nothing better then a freak. I just want to be a child again.\n\n",

        "body": "28m. All my life I have treated people the way I would want to be treated. The golden rule, supposedly a great thing to live by but it has served me nothing but putting me to the lowest point in my life.\n\nI\u2019ve never had great self esteem and was a very shy child. This has carried into my adult life. While I am much less shy now, I still really don\u2019t like myself. I tend to search out approval and validation from others, but I don\u2019t really feel like anyone cares. I know I need to feed my own happiness, but it all feels so fake and delusional to constantly tell myself this while not getting much proof from others that this is true.\n\nI feel as if I have no real friends, yes many acquaintances, but no real friends. Rarely do I get people reaching out to me, and if they do it\u2019s mostly to vent or tell me about themselves. I rarely get asked about how I am while I will have entire conversations about what the other person has going on, how they\u2019re doing. I will ask questions and continue the conversation. There is barely any reciprocation and the conversation just does after because they don\u2019t ask about me. And when I get up the confidence to share a cool thin I did with someone they don\u2019t really ask much more. Even the people who I will send funny reels to or a video or anything that I think they might like or find funny, they will usually just leave me on read or won\u2019t watch or listen at all and just start talking about what they have going on. \n\nThere have been many  occasions where I might not necessarily understand why someone does something but I will really make the effort to ask questions and try and understand, and most occasions I do. But on my side there have been so many occasions with my \u201cfriends\u201d that they will actually say to my face that \u201cI actually don\u2019t really care\u201d or they \u201cdon\u2019t understand, but that\u2019s fine\u201d when I am trying to explain why I like something, or talk about something I maybe excited about , etc.\n\nI also never feel like I\u2019m heard. When I talk in a group everyone tends to talk over me. Yes I may do the same on occasion, but I will apologize after my interruption and ask the person to keep going. Sometimes I just feel like a ghost. People don\u2019t move out of my way, they will bump into me or I will move out of their way. Sometimes I feel like I could disappear and not many people would notice. \n\nI just want people to treat me like I matter and they care.\n\nI hope this isn\u2019t too all over the place",

The damage is still there, though, from when I was a very hard person to tolerate.\n\nNobody owes you forgiveness, but I wish it didn't hurt as much to witness once healthy friendships just burn out. \n\nI understand how the other side feels. When my depression is really bad, I know I can be very difficult to be around and talk to. \n\nIt also seems that people lose patience and distance themselves from that person. That's understandable, because I know how draining it can be to be around me when I'm in a depressive episode.\n\nIt feels like a lose-lose situation. You lose friendships that you once cherished, and so do the other people. \n\nThe only solution seems to be to keep fighting, and I guess eventually finding people who are patient and understanding.

I snooze my alarms for hours, pushing myself to be later and later to my job. I suppose a lucky thing that my job doesn't have the strictest rules, but I still hate going in late so I try to avoid it. I know that my best bet is to quit my job and find something else that I can actually look forward to doing, but my job is integrated into one of my classes so I'm trapped in this job for at least another month until the semester ends. I'm just so tired all of the time, but I can't and won't catch up on my sleep because I don't want the next day to come. ",

I've gotten the help, been to therapy, taken medication, I've even been hospitalized, at no point has it made it any better. At best, it has sort of stabilized me at times. I tried to kill myself 4 years ago, and there hasn't been a single time I can say I was happy I didn't succeed. \n\n\nAll that being said, my question is why? Why keep going? What logical reason exists as to why I shouldn't be allowed to kill myself? Every single answer I've gotten, whether online or from therapist, is complete and utter bullshit. Every single response can be flipped on itself one way or another. \n\n\"You never know, things may get better, so you should stick around to see\"\n\nThings may also get worse, so I should kill myself to avoid finding out\n\n\"It's a permanent solution to temporary problems\"\n\nIt's not a solution to any problem, but it is a way to make myself have no problems\n\n\"You only want to make this decision because you're mentally ill\"\n\nBut what of every single other decision I make? I have a drivers license and I work with children, every decision I make in regards to those is seen as sane. For what reason is suicide the only decision I make that isn't rational? \n\n\n\"Your suicide would hurt other people\"\n\nAny reason given that involves other people isn't valid. There's no way to quantify pain, so whose to say the suffering my suicide would cause is greater than the suffering myself and others would face, given the decisions I make should I stay alive. \n\n\"You don't actually want to die, you just want to right now\"\n\nYes, I don't WANT to die, I've never wanted to die, even when I was preparing all those pills, I didn't want to die. I think death is the best alternative to everything else. I want to live and have a good life, but that is just something I am incapable of doing, for one reason or another. I don't want to die, I want to be dead. ",

It is a horrible disorder that i have struggled with for 8 years now. I don't believe that I will completely recover from this. I know some of us won't. Some of us will commit suicide, some won't find suitable treatment. I know, that it can be treated completely but it doesn't have to, even with therapy, pills, loving people around. \n\n\nWhat i have found comforting, is that, with being prone to depression, being neurotic comes certain sensitivity, that may allow us to understand each other and help those struggling.  I've found myself quite helpful with listening to others, giving proper advice and I wouldnt be able to do so without this depression. It is much easier to properly help others than it is to help yourself. One day You might save someones life because of what You are going through right now. Try to listen to others who you think might be struggling. Not because of selflessness, which I don't believe in, but becuase it is possible to find comfort for yourself by doing so.\n\n\nThis is obvious for some of you but it wasn't for me so maybe it changes anything for anyone. Although be careful, because it can become some sort of escape from your problems and those must be a priority.\n\n\nThis probably wont help those in their worst right now. Those peopleneed to think mostly about themselves and its okay, its natural and important. But try this when you can and are able to.\n\nBtw english is not my first language. It is my first post and im not checking for errors, so sorry foreventual incorrections.",

Born in France, raised in Ethiopia living in Canada for 7 years, and since I moved here at the age of 16, my studies are completely lost. I don't even know where I am anymore. I left high school here before I got my diploma and at the age of 21 I enrolled in university and quickly realized with horror that without a diploma I wouldn't go anywhere. I feel a little too old to go back to high school but at the same time I have a dream, I want to be a lawyer one day and have a stable job. A stable job especially because at the moment I am unemployed and extremely depressed because of it. I feel like I've ruined everything, no work, no diploma, no driver license and no money. \n\nI'm afraid of falling even more into the abyss but should I start all over again to study law?",

My dad died when i was 10 and ever since then all the days mush together and my sensee of time has been warped. I also feel like thats the root of all this heartache and confusion Im feeling. I have hardly any friends both male and female. And any time a female does show me any attention i become attached immediately and i wish it wasnt that way. I just feel like loosing my dad so early stunted my development and i still feel like a kid when im a full ass adult. Trauma is really weird. My mom was also emotionally absent and i was left to deal with all these feelings myself until it got so bad i threatened suicide then it was whatever prescription the dr recommended. I love my mom but sometimes it feels like she could care less about me until it starts affecting her. I see all these kids that graduated with me going into their careers and finding love and starting families and i feel so lost and dont know where i would even start trying to find a career. Im really tired of feeling like this i dont want to die but i dont see the purpose in living.",

        "title": "Scared of life",
        "body": "Hello. I'm there to whine about myself, write what's on my mind, what's bothering me.\nI'm 24, on my last semester, in a process of writing my masters.\n\nWhat's on my chest? I'm scared of my future. I really do not know what to do in a couple of months with myself. This frightens me a lot. Maybe things would be easier if I rented something instead of living in a student dorm as I maybe would have some idea how this works, but that would be too expensive so here I am. I really feel like I've failed at a game named life, technically simple sounding life situations being massive burden to me, making me feel as if it's close to the end of my life, not that it would be a bad thing in a literal sense. That's just one thing, but seemingly major at the moment, though there are many more things which stress me. What if my master thesis sucked, what if I'd skipped something during literature review for my thesis and everything would be invalidated? What if I suck at work, what if I will underperform at work, what if I say something that I'll regret horribly... this should give you an idea. Those feelings are paralizing to me. I feel insanely lazy, inadequate, procrastinating a lot, which is only making me even more anxious about things.\n\nAnother point is that I feel like I'm withdrawn from the society. I'm mostly making only transactional interactions with others. I'm generally interested in some things that are happening for other people but that's another transaction for me. I only query for some information that seems entertaining to me, to know more about someone, but for what reason? Just to entertain myself I guess. I don't find myself being an interesting person, which will only get worse most likely with my graduation. I'm seriously considering a doctorate at this point... but am I smart enough? I basically can only talk about university stuff, but what else? I can't really talk about my job other than that I'm a software engineer. Maybe I could have some small chats about anime. I find myself struggling with conversations, sometimes stuttering a bit, but having difficulties with finding the right words to tell what I intend to, though now when I think of it, do I really know what I intend to say? Funnily enough I can hold whole Oxford debates with myself in front of the mirror, at least I think they're pretty good. For now people seem to understand what I mean so that's a bit calming, though it would be nice if I could speak more clearly.\nThe previous point derailed a bit, so returning to me being withdrawn, I'm aware that there are concepts of colleagues and friends, the latter being technically the 'closer' one. I can't though grasp the concept of a friend. When someone becomes a friend? What are the things that friends are capable of but I shouldn't expect them from just colleagues? I remember once being to a birthday party of a classmate, when I was much younger but I remember being completely lost there, like I just went with whatever was happening there. I remember one thing that was pretty entertaining during the party though and this was fixing a sound driver issue on my classmate's PC. I've never really liked social events neither at school nor anywhere for whatever occasion, especially family ones, trying to skip as many as I could. A good question would be then, what I spend my time on? I've played games, spent time in my room, pretty much wasted a major part of my life. I despise myself for that. I sometimes wonder what could I achieve if I had some extra push? It doesn't matter now. I am where I am and there aren't time machines. I'd love to remove those last few sentences, since they're extremely embarrassing to me, but leaving them is maybe a good idea to just let it off my chest.\n\nI feel like there's so much stuff I'd love to add, but I don't have an idea what. This makes me feel like I'm a dumb LM model just waiting for a prompt to generate some output. I think that to hold myself together somehow, I will turn to be a workaholic, just to find a purpose for myself, though what I wrote earlier about being anxious of makes me worry how I'll progress throughout my life.\nI'm scared of a feeling of regression, my gray cells decomposing as I live, forgetting things I've worked hard to learn and remember. This feeling only grew within me over the years. I'm even anxious that I will accept it at some point in my life.\n\nThis should be obvious now, but I think it now connects some previous things - my romantic life being best summarized with a '0'. Do I feel bad about it? It's difficult to answer this question. Using my understanding of myself, I'm pretty sure I've never beared any romantic feelings towards anyone. I'm sure though that the only feeling I've had was pure desire, but nothing more than that. I don't understand what a difference is between a friend and a [insert sex of your choice]friend. I think that the only difference are 'bonus functions', lacking better terms. I hope this section provides a bit wider understanding of how I feel.\nSo I've established that I'm not particularly sociable, even when it comes to intimate stuff, valuing just the function. Yet I have an unpleasant feeling that I need some kind of interaction with other people, I want some unpredictability in them, but coming out and speaking my mind scares me. It scares me that they will find it unpleasant, offensive maybe. It frightens me that I might say something that I'll regret saying, which could have major consequences. It's not that bad prefering to have a chat with an LLM over a real human as they're not quite on a level to substitute a real human. I complain a lot, but have no one to listen to me, at least in the way I'd feel safe about telling something like what is written there and more.\n\nThe only form of happiness I get is when I finally solve some dumb issue, find an answer, everything in code works, that I find a short surge of satisfaction. But it's a difficult source and unreliable and what about the life? I absolutely don't know how to get that just from life.\nIn summary I don't a lot of things about myself, my mind, my lack of skills, my lazyness, my fear, my body, etc. I'm not sure if I feel better after dumping a bit of my thoughts in this post or if I'm just feeling sleepy, so those bad feelings will repeat themselves again, though most likely they will. I hope that someone will actually manage to read through this pile of chaos. Thank you.",

But it all feels like it\u2019s falling apart. Everyone I know just uses me as their own personal therapist. It\u2019s too much to bear. My wife hasn\u2019t been talking to me as much. My job is as stressful as everything else. I have to watch people die routinely. I hate it. Everything I do at this point is for my kids. Life feels hollow. I feel like I\u2019m on the edge of relapsing.\n",

I haven't had the chance to talk to a psychiatrist or therapist about anything of how i'm feeling, but it's pretty much everywhere with my emotions, one moment I can be all happy and laughing and not 15 minutes later i'm feeling off and lonely even though i'm in a room full of people. I have been mistreated before with past relationships with family members as my mother and my father, they both aren't even in my life but I wouldn't say this hasn't had a big impact on me as i'm doing just fine without them.. I have been mistreated a lot in my life, with bullying and assault.. and all the things that come with bullying and such, I think this has hindered how I talk to people my age as im kind of a person not a lot of people like, i live in a small town too.. so everyone knows everyone.. and it's not that l've done anything bad but it's just i'm awkward.. I can\u2019t hold conversation, I can\u2019t socialize, I know people think of me in a negative light, I know im treated differently, I get irritated sometimes without having any reason to be mad.. some days i\u2019ll have a good day and some days i\u2019ll have a bad day but mostly it\u2019s bad days.. and nothing really happens during them to make me upset.. this also might be a factor but i've noticed i have been more compulsive with how i act, here are some examples; Making a mess out of spray paint, Cutting my hair, drinking things that shouldn't be drunken.. and s/h which has been pretty rampantly used over a year or two... I do have some disorders like ADHD but it's the only thing that's been confirmed.. l've read some things that have said ADHD makes you more compulsive.",

A life of being surrounded by shitty people, then becoming a shitty person and oozing that nastiness into all the good people around me that don't deserve it. I'm a putrid spawn of vile creatures. Wicked mean self centered assholes, and I'm just like them, only uglier and more broke and more full of myself. Fuck I hope to whatever cosmic demon rules this universe that there is no afterlife, no reincarnation, no continuation, no river from which the droplets departed. I hope, I pray, that life is just a weird cosmic mistake and that what comes after will be what came before, just empty abyss. Nothingness. Absence of all thought and feeling and form. I hope that eternal nothingness gets here soon, tonight preferably, so I don't have to wake up and be a part of any of this again. ",

        "body": "here it is: \n\ni\u2019m not really sure on how to start this so here. By the time you've read this hopefully I'm dead. I've always had a pessimistic outlook on life and I never wanted to live past thirteen. I knew I've wanted to die since I was born. Nothing ever made me happy, Nothing filled the void in my chest. Nothing made my life worth living. The world would be a better place without me. Every single day of my life I've thought about killing myself and after several failed attempts hopefully this one worked. I wasn't smart, funny, pretty or a good person. I'm a piece of shit that got what she deserved. I've always struggled with depression but no one believed or took me seriously. Depression has always been this thing that followed me around and no one could see that I was struggling or even bothered to help me. Not that I have anyone to blame besides myself. I knew the only thing that would make me happy was dying. I've always seen death as a second option. Something freeing in a way. Even if i did get the help i needed i would\u2019ve ended up with the same resolution. I never saw myself graduating or going to college. I'm not good at anything and have no hobbies, passion, or motivation. Senior year has been the absolute worst year of my life and I've never hated myself more. After losing my best friend I knew nothing in my life would be worth living. I'm sorry to everyone I've disappointed and let down. I take full responsibility for what I've done because this is what I wanted. This wasn\u2019t an impulsive decision either. I know this is what I want. I felt numb and empty all the time. I knew I wasn't alone but no matter what I felt alone. I felt like there was this huge gap between everyone else and me. I hated everything and didn\u2019t see the point of functioning in everyday life. I'm tired of never being taken seriously and all of my problems being overlooked. I'm tired of being a people pleaser and being a doormat. Maybe now people will actually listen. i\u2019ve always felt replaceable and like a burden. \n\nto my family, don\u2019t blame yourself. This was a well thought out decision and something that I've been wanting to do. I'm sorry for being a troubled kid and putting you through the worst. \n\nMom: I love you so much. You were my everything and an amazing mother. I know we had our differences but I couldn't have asked for a better mother. Thank you for always being there for me and helping me save up for the car. all of the money can go to you, shanelle & dad. I appreciate you, you have no idea. I'm sorry I never told you how pretty I really thought you were. you\u2019re so beautiful. don\u2019t blame yourself, you did nothing wrong. My favorite memory was our shopping sprees that we\u2019d go to when I was younger and we\u2019d go to macys. \n\nshanelle (sister): i love you shanelle. you were a second mother. I hate having to leave you but I will still always be there. continue to be the amazing, hardcore marvel fan that you are. I love you so much. you were the best older sister anyone could ask for. I'll miss all the times we laughed. I hope you continue your nursing career. you made me so happy or at least what i considered happy. My favorite memory was all the times we\u2019d eat food and watch our shows together. i always looked forward to that. \n\ndad: Thank you for everything. You were an amazing father and I will always love you. I'm sorry we never spent much time together but the times we went to dinner were my favorite memories. you\u2019re the best and you tried your best and that\u2019s all i could ever ask for. I know you wanted the best for me and I'm sorry I could not give that to you. My favorite memory was us jumping on the bed together when I was younger. I've always kept that memory. \n\nmaggie: Maggie I love you so much & still do. Even after our fallout I never had an ounce of hate for you in my heart. you were one of the only people who i felt truly got me in my entire life. i\u2019m sorry that i wasn\u2019t a good friend to you and truly wish things between us would\u2019ve ended differently/didn\u2019t end at all. After our friendship ended everything in my life changed and in no way shape or form am I blaming you because once again this is something I wanted. you\u2019re going to be an amazing orthodontist and I can't wait to see you succeed in the world. Thank you for helping me find out who I really am. My favorite memory was when you and I would sing to the customers at cinnaholic and they\u2019d all stare at us. \n\ncasandra: casandra you were an amazing friend to me as well. We talked about so many things and you were there for me and we talked about things I've never told anyone. You are so smart and always knew exactly what to say. You are everything I want to be as a person. My favorite memory was our late night facetimes. \n\ntaylor: you\u2019re so sweet, kind and sensitive. never change. I love you too Taylor, I'm sorry for always messing up and ruining everything. never change. My favorite memory was our bottoms movie day. \n\nshaleya: i love you so much and appreciate everything you\u2019ve ever done for me. You were the only consistent friend I had and you were there for me all year. I'm sorry I didn't say how much you meant to me more often. My favorite memory was our October spirit Halloween era. \n\nl christle: i love you so much. you always put a smile on my face no matter what. you were one the funniest people i\u2019ve ever met. you\u2019re going to do great things in this world. i know it. never change either. My favorite memory was that one time I came over to your house and we stayed out really late. \n\nto all my friends I could\u2019ve said more but i don\u2019t have the energy to type that much so sorry for this shitty letter. \n\nps: I don't want a funeral. I seriously don\u2019t want this to become a whole thing and an investigation to happen, just let me die and move on. my only wish is for everyone to forget about me and move on. \n",

Sometimes the feeling comes from \"there is no point to anything, so why not\" or \"I'm just so exhausted; i dont want to do this\" or \"life is too unbearable and its not gonna get better.\"\n\n I have self harmed but not to die, but because I was in too much pain and I needed a distraction. I live at home with family and if I didn't, I think I would just let myself rot and die from starvation.\n\nThere's always been this logical part of my brain that overrides my feelings and says \"feelings are temporary; just wait it out.\" Lately, suicide just feels like it makes sense. I've tried exercise and that helps a little sometimes. I looked up what to do when I feel like this. I don't think I'll ever use the help hotline. The other big tip was to contact someone I trust to talk about how I'm feeling. But I can't find it in me, to trust anyone right now. All these little things that have broken my heart just never really heal and keep adding up. I don't really know what to do?",

I have a few friends but no deep connections with anyone. The one goal I\u2019ve had in life that actually mattered to me was to get married and have children, but unfortunately I\u2019ve come to accept that this will likely never come to fruition (I know it\u2019s very old fashioned. I think it stems from the fact that I have always craved deep social connections above anything else, and I kinda view family as one of the ultimate ways to get that.) \n\nAll I do is go to work and come home and watch tv and maybe text a friend or two. The only accomplishments I have in life are work or school related\u2014all things that mean nothing in the end. I\u2019ve reached a point in the last 1 or 2 years where I can barely socialize because I can hardly tolerate even speaking to people. \n\nI would honestly take things into my own hands and end my life if I could, but I\u2019m scared that I will fail and end up with deficits. I can\u2019t do this anymore, I can\u2019t take the loneliness. I don\u2019t know what to do, nothing helps and I\u2019ve come to accept that depression is honestly just part of who I am at this point. ",

And trust me when I say that I'm tired.\n\nBut today I kinda realised that maybe there's something left for me. I don't know. Things are changing and I'm not a kid anymore. I have no idea about what I'll do with my life or where to go and I just know it will be hard, but maybe I will be able to get out of here some day if I don't give everything up. Maybe I have a future.\nAnd that possibility of me being out of here gives me a little bit of  strength to keep going everyday. Is that something? \n\nEven though I'm sure it won't be worse, it will be different. And difficult. But I hope I can find peace eventually.\nThanks for reading, I hope you can find what you need too.",

        "body": "It\u2019s ruining my life. I(F19) have been depressed for 7 years now and each day that passes somehow manages to be worse than the last. I only have positive emotions about life for maybe 10 minutes each week, and then I go back to feeling terrible and empty. I\u2019ve been going to therapy for about 3 years now, I\u2019m currently on my 4th therapist who I like so far, but I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m getting better. She\u2019s lovely to talk to, but it\u2019s not helping much. I have also recently started taking medication, which I\u2019m desperately waiting for it to work.\n\nI had this stupid thought that when I turned 18, my depression would magically go away. That since I finished high school, I wouldn\u2019t be in pain anymore. But I\u2019ve only gotten worse. I have trouble sleeping and staying asleep and my thoughts get so overwhelming that the only way I can cope is through I self harm. When I started I thought  it was going to be a one time thing, but now I can\u2019t stop.\n\nI also hate that depression makes me feel unloveable, that since I\u2019m sad nobody will never love me, and that I don\u2019t deserve to love anyone because of it. I understand love is human and I crave it so back but I can\u2019t help but think it\u2019s selfish to put that type of burden on someone else, so I just continue to be alone. I wish I had someone else but maybe romance isn\u2019t for me, maybe I\u2019m the type of person who deserves to be alone. But all I want is so desperately to have someone else, someone who loves me and will talk to me. \nWhy can\u2019t I have that?\n\nI know I\u2019m young and am probably trying to rush into stuff, but I think I\u2019m in such a hurry because everyday it feels like my world\u2019s ending. Everyday my thoughts get worse, everyday I contemplate suicide and I just don\u2019t know how much I have left in me. Which is why I guess I want things to go well for me now.\n\nAnd I guess I hate depression because it\u2019s not fair. I see other people live their lives without depression, and it\u2019s just not fair. I don\u2019t want this, I didn\u2019t ask for it, so why am I being tortured. It\u2019s not fair that I have to live the rest of my life like this. It\u2019s so not fair. Why can\u2019t I just be normal, I don\u2019t want to have these issues anymore. Why can\u2019t I just live like normal people, why does my life have to consist of so much pain.\n",

I've tried, and I don't know what else to do, I have family I have to live with, but I'm to afraid to disappoint them, so it's difficult to get my own antidepressants. It's funny to me how the best moments in my life were the ones where I repressed everything the most. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I don't think I can hold on for as long as I'd like to.

When I was able, I cleaned, I drove him everywhere (he doesn\u2019t have a license) and because of my lack of job recently, the only thing that was hard was to contribute to presents or gifts. But I have tried hard to knock it out of the park, Christmas was good and I\u2019m driving us to the Draft this year since he really wants to go. Recently, it feels like whenever he puts in a small amount of effort he wants a Pat on the back and me to sing his praises, which is really frustrating. I don\u2019t ask for praise when I get him gifts, and all of his are surprises. The last gift he got me was the first surprise gift I have gotten, and I really like it, but he consistently talks about how amazing he is for doing it, other gifts were things he bought because he told me to pick them out. I just feel like things like that are expected in any relationship. I feel like I\u2019m not much of a priority and that he only values me at times because I do a lot for him and have done a lot for him. I know that\u2019s a boundary and communication thing that I need to work on myself. My issue is, even feeling this way about him is hard for me. I feel ungrateful and I feel like a bitch which only makes me feel worse. I\u2019m in this constant cycle of feeling like a horrible useless person and it\u2019s getting difficult to bear.

I am generally very even keeled and know that most people are neutral actors. The problem is that when I am experiencing depression, my natural ability to give people the benefit of the doubt decreases substantially.  Logically, I know that most people are still neutral.  Emotionally, retaining that neutral feeling becomes a huge uphill battle.  I can come away from an interation having the full awareness that, at any other time, it would have seemed neutral, but during depressive episodes, it just *feels so bad*.  This is the illogical nature of depression on display.    \n\n\nAs someone who is usually able to control his emotions fairly well, this is always super frustrating.  I have come away from some very neutral conversations today feeling unwarranted things like fear and extreme sadness.  I even have thought about going to the bathroom to cry.    \n\n\nI know that this will go away at some point, but dealing with it in the moment makes me so upset.

Now, I could be seen as a crazy ex, but I still genuinely love and care about my ex, although her behavior is weird. I first noticed something a month ago: my ex started talking to me less and became more distant. At first, I thought it was because she was about to have her period, as she usually becomes more distant the week before. So, I thought nothing of it. Turns out, it was. She had her period, and she wasn\u2019t as loving and clingy as she usually is. Over the next couple of weeks, this behavior continued, and then she broke up with me. The signs were all there of her falling out of love, so I didn\u2019t think much about it. She ended up getting back with me, but over the course of the next week, she became really distant. We ended up breaking up for good. After the breakup, she was abnormally cold and told me she feels numb. Now, this is where I asked her if it\u2019s just towards me or everything, and she said everything. At first, I didn\u2019t believe her and just thought she fell out of love like couples do, but I texted one of her best friends, and he told me that she was making him mad too because she was also really distant and cold to him. Now, as I think about it, the way she went from being seriously in love with me to just not caring was really quick and sudden, and she also randomly texts me \u201cI love you.\u201d I\u2019m just concerned and wondering if anyone has any insight on what could be going on.",

Which is probably the case. I don't want to even bother trying anymore. I want to dissappear.\n\nOne could argue that since I'm still on the younger side I can turn my life around and get that happy ending but I don't believe in that. Everytime I tried it was squandered one way or another. And, I genuinely don't understand people want to live. I envy them, actually.

I\u2019m barely sleeping, I can\u2019t remember the last time I drank water, I\u2019m just surviving at the minute, it\u2019s a horrible feeling. I\u2019ve had the last week off work as I physically couldn\u2019t pull myself out the rut I was in every morning and even putting my socks on getting out of bed would send me into a spiral of guilt and anxiety. I went in yesterday and I did a good job at staying the whole day, but had a crying episode halfway through the day infront of everyone because a child hit me, I\u2019m embarrassed, I feel useless, and I\u2019m fed up of everything, my therapist wants me to call the doctors to change my antidepressants but if I\u2019m honest I can\u2019t be bothered, ugh honestly I\u2019m stopping myself it\u2019s so hard to get out of this mindset. Can anyone else relate?\nIt honestly feels easier to just admit myself to the hospital, no phone calls to make appointments, someone reminding me to drink and eat, being looked after. Please tell me I\u2019m not alone.",

I hear \"Comparison is the thief of joy\" but everything is about comparison. When I apply for a job I'm being compared, if I'm trying to find a SO I'm going to be compared. \"Stop worrying about what others think about you.\" Okay, what happens when what someone thinks about me matters? My dad, as often as he spouted trash, told me that \"Life is like an icy slope, you need to keep scrambling just to stay where you are, and if you want to relax and stop, you'll start sliding.\" The world doesn't stop and wait for us to heal. And yes, humans don't exist on a single spectrum where one can be objectively behind in life, but there are enough cases in life where you are measured against others that it's hard not to lose hope after sliding so far down the slope trying to take baby steps.

I am so alone in everything I am dealing with and healing generational trauma while trying to be a good parent to my 8 month old daughter. I feel like every time I try to breathe something pushes me back under the water. I have had a very hard life. My parents were in and out of my life as they pleased, separating me and my siblings just to hand us off to whoever would take us whether it be aunts or grandmas. When I lived with my grandmother I was sexually assaulted by my cousin. I tried to tell my family what was happening and they didn\u2019t believe me or just didn\u2019t want to deal with it and shipped me off to my grandparents on my dads side of the family. The only way I can describe what this event makes me feel like is- dirty. I\u2019ve felt dirty since it happened when I was around 10 years of age. And often times questioned whether it really happened, but I still wake often to nightmares to remind myself it was true and to not accept being gaslighted because it\u2019s an uncomfortable situation to deal with. I legally emancipated parents and was living with a friend and her family. Her mom was in my eyes a hero, until the checks stopped coming in for her \u201ctaking care\u201d of me. Everything quickly turned into a nightmare, physical and emotion violence became a normal everyday thing. I can still vividly hear her screams and things slamming while begging her to stop. My safe haven was crumbling. She put a lot of pressure on me and her kids because she had a rough upbringing as well. Instead of learning from her trauma she thought it was only fair we had a hard time too. She became a textbook narcissist- everything was about what she needed emotionally and would often confide in me her marital issues, I had to clean the house and pick her kids up basically became Cinderella. She was also doing a lot of cocaine which made her outbursts inevitable every single day. My boyfriend had seen what I was going through and moved me into to his parents immediately. Ten years later we are engaged with our beautiful daughter. I\u2019m supposed to be my happiest now that I\u2019m out of harms way and have everything I could ever want, but I feel so empty and broken inside which makes me feel so guilty. My thoughts are constantly consumed with what everyone around me needs, what I need to fix within myself, whether or not I\u2019m a good mom. I feel like my feelings and thoughts aren\u2019t even mine anymore. And I don\u2019t want to feel this broken. I\u2019m angry, resentful, scared and exhausted. I worry every second that If I\u2019m not perfect all the time that I will fuck my daughter up like how life did to me. I can\u2019t eat or sleep and having panic attacks where I can\u2019t move my hands, they get stuck like crab claws. I don\u2019t have resources or time for a therapist.  Please anyone just talk to me there is so much I left out I just need to talk to someone. I don\u2019t want to bother my parent anymore with this he\u2019s going through so much right now as well. Please someone talk to me. \n",

I don't even have the motivation to live, so getting back into the habit of doing normal things seems impossible right now. I'm exhausted all the time, I have no friends, and I frankly do not care about my future at all. I'm financially dependent on my parents and I'm unable to get a job for the same reasons I can't go back to school.

        "body": "Im 16 years old. In around 2022 I started working out, but took it more seriously in 2023. I liked to use my cat as my motivation, I tried to better myself for \u201chim\u201d. For some reason me thinking this gave me the most motivation ive had in my life, and it even got me to learn about god and believe in him. My cat went missing in july 2023, and I found his tail in my backyard.\nEver since this ive lost compete motivation, ive smoked weed almost everyday for the past multiple months, to just not think about it. I havent been motivated in anything, i havent been motivated in working out, taking care of myself, nothing. I dont know if its stupid, but he meant so much to me. Ive felt what i think is derealization, and I just dont even feel real 80% of my day and i think this is most likely from me smoking. I dont know if i believe in god anymore after this either, as this wasnt something that was deserved but I know people say god does stuff like this still. Id like to believe in god again as that gave me alot of motivation too, but its so hard to try to believe in him again after this\nId like to get back into my old motivation but I just dont know where to start it. I never experienced a loss that has been this close to me, me and him spent all day everyday together. Any advice for this?\n",

I just don\u2019t know where else to talk about this. But right now my plan is to take 103 1mg pills of cogentin and mix it with a lot of alcohol, maybe throw in some more other kinds of pills just for good measure. I\u2019m not sure if I will act on this plan. I keep coming really close but I hesitate. I know I need to just do it. Sorry sorry I\u2019m probably breaking the rules. Just delete me. Like everyone and everything always does. \n\nEdit: for context I\u2019m a 26 F with chronic depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Nothing much else as far as I know.. I am not in school or working. I\u2019m leeching off my parents like a pathetic POS because my ass is too scared to leave the house and work. ",

He\u2019s 19 turning 20 this year. \n\nHe told my mom to kill herself, that shes a terrible mother etc. and she always calls him every night asking about his day. I live with her and she never asks me. She doesn\u2019t grocery shop for me because im 16 while she cooks for my brother who still lives with my dad and personally delivers the food to him. \n\nim completely unmotivated to do anything, but i still always help out around the house for me mom so she doesnt feel like im being lazy. i do the dishes, the laundry, i clean the house, i make her tea whenever shes feeling down and im really trying to be a good daughter. Im doing everything i can. \n\nI want to get a job since im doing so terrible in school. But i dont even have a card because my mom always complains \u201cwhat do you need it for?\u201d and then complains i dont have a job. I dont get an allowance, whereas when my brother was 16 parents taught him everything, they got him a job, everything he needed to get him started. Even though he has a job, parents still give him money whenever he needs it. \n\nTo add to all that, my brother has been sexually assaulting me whenever im near since i was 9. He did it infront of his friends to the point they started doing it to me. I ended up telling my parents when i was 14 and they completely ignored it. They took his side. \n\nim so lost, i dont know what i have done. they gave all these opportunities to my brother and i was just a cleaner to them that they would feed. \n\nMy brother dropped out first semester of college and parents were completely fine with it. He has such an easy life, everything was hand fed to him. Our mom felt bad because he didnt get a birthday cake for him 19th birthday while i havent been getting anything for my birthday expect a sleepover \n\nThis year, i spent my birthday away from home, My mom was on a vacation in turkey with her friends, my dad was working. I didnt even get a phone call from either of them. its was my 16th birthday. the only call i got was from my cousin that i havent talked to since 2015. The present my mom got me? \u00a310. while she was spending money on gifts for her friends in turkey. \n\nThe gift from my dad was nothing. I got nothing on my 16. i keep trying to look at the bright side but there isnt one. wtf am i supposed to do.\n ",

However, I don't think a phase lasts for years.\n\nThis all started when I was 11. I just began to feel down about myself. I would assault myself with \"my parents don't love me\" or \"your grades are terrible\". I've heard people complaining that teenagers have \"sad phases\", but usually those go away. Mine never did.\n\nWhenever I hung out with family, I put on a fake smile because I didn't want to show my true self. They all gossip about eachother when the other is not around, so I wonder if they talk about me behind my back.\n\nI turned 13 last year, and I thought surely the sadness would stop, but it never did. It just snowballed into self-hatred. My self esteem dropped. I call myself ugly every day. I usually blame myself for the hell I experience. I never told my parents, nor ever will. I know they won't understand, because they don't care. Hell, I talk with my teachers more than my parents. Pathetic, I know. If they won't take time out of my day to help me with school, or to even talk to me, then they certainly won't to talk about my \"feelings\".\n\nFor those of you wondering, I'm still waiting. Waiting for the day this hell ends. Waiting until my \"phase\" is over, but for now, I'm a 13 year old who feels like shit.",

I sincerely love him because he is the type of guy I\u2019ve always wanted to be with, but never thought I\u2019d be lucky enough to. For most of our relationship, we have been able to communicate well and consistently. Since late last year, he\u2019s gone through some changes with work and school so I think the stresses of trying to manage them has gotten to him. When he\u2019s felt depressed in the past, he\u2019s gone quiet for a bit, but always reached out to me after a few days. This time it\u2019s different. He\u2019s shared with me that he feels things are getting worse, he has no motivation, basically going through the motions. When things are really bad, he said he can get into\nepisodes where he shuts down completely. I\u2019ve tried to do check ins here and there, but he isn\u2019t responsive. I want to respect his space, it\u2019s just a part of me loves him a lot and I want him to know he\u2019s not alone. Sometimes I fear him being alone and dwelling on this can put him in a negative echo chamber. This guy means a lot to me, I really do not want to lose him. He hasn\u2019t mentioned anything about breaking up, but I am so afraid that might happen. I\u2019m trying my hardest to stay positive, but honestly with bad experiences dating, depression and both of us going through self harm in the past\u2026 I\u2019m so worried for him. Any insight or advice into understanding this would be much appreciated. ",

Then, for some reason, the thought of the sub still being visible at 9pm makes me more depressed. I probably feel more depressed in the summer, but even in the winter, I don't go out if it's sunny. Sometimes I'll go out or open my curtains if it's cloudy. Every day feels calmer and less overwhelming to me the darker it is. And if I ever need light, I have led wall lights that aren't too overwhelmingly bright, and I can adjust their brightness, unlike the sun. But, I wouldn't mind if somebody turned the sun off. That shit too bright. I tend to hibernate when it's out.",

I just want to lay in bed and rot away or fall asleep and never wake up. I'm still miraculously invited to things or asked to hangout, and I always say no because the thought of faking another smile or moment of joy sickens me. If I do somehow agree, I know I'll end up cancelling and feel like shit. Most of my friends know I'm struggling, but there's only so much understanding a person can have. I know they probably will give up on me; I'm a lost cause. I'd give up on me too. It's probably so clear that I'm fucked up and don't care- SELFISH. I'm a shell, hollow version of the person I once was, and I know they can see it. My expressions are dead; my emotions are dead; the light/spark has faded from my eyes. It's like talking to a robot. I'm going to end up even more alone, but how do I stop it? I feel helpless. ",

        "body": "In December I had to cut off a woman that I love from my life. Even though I agree with all the people that told me she was toxic I just can't help but feel regret and remorseful on how things ended. She came into my life at a time when I was afraid of interacting with others and despised most people. For her she'd say I was her best friend and she'd make subtle and not so subtle attempts to be around me as much as possible and it made me happy. She started to thaw the ice in my heart just as I did for her as she would tell me she doesn't have many friends and the ones she does have rarely spoke to her and even more uncommon was them making an effort to see her. I was a change of pace for her as I made an effort to talk to her and see her. I'd be there for her emotionally as well as I hated to see her cry and she'd come to me to talk about her past traumas and things that were currently bothering her. It became a norm that when she cried I'd hold her in my arms and she'd allow herself to melt. It'd eventually be a norm where I'd just hold her even when she wasn't crying and this made me feel good just as it did her. I'd put head on her lap and all my problems would just go away. Now I don't talk to her anymore and as much as I know it's for the best it also hurts so damn much. Made worse by the fact that my previous job of which I got her to work there with me because I wanted to help her find work and she meanwhile said yes for that reason and because it'd mean we could see each other more. They told me after I stopped working there and a family member of mine spread a lie if me being dead she got depressed and had suicidal thoughts. I'd clear up the lie to her personally but a week after that is when I cut her off and according to my previous job her depression didn't go away. She no longer had those suicidal thoughts but her depression stayed. Soon enough she'd quit because of it and my job said if she didn't quit they were planning in letting her go anyway because her work had been sliding. My heart hurts that I can't talk to her but it hurts more to know that she suffered from this. Life for me has been going up since I broke things off. I got a promotion in the army and I'm now a SGT, bought my own house, got a puppy, and a new job in the army that haa me in France right now. Yet this heartache I feel just won't go away. I miss you beautiful, I wish things didn't end the way it did, and I HATE the other people that made things worse and influenced our close friendship ending.",

        "body": "Has anyone else's depression almost get them fired? So I work alone in a bank call center as a custodian. It's a 2 floor call center. And I can get most of my work done in under 5 hours. Lately I'll admit, my depression has been really bad. So bad that all I've done in the past 2 weeks is the bare minimum work (clean bathrooms, empty trashcans, vacuum up crumbs under cubicles). Do I need to do more than that? Absolutely. But my depression has just been so bad that I have no energy to do much of anything. When my depression acts up at work I go and sit in my car for hours on end and just stare blankly out the window or cry. Well yesterday my supervisor came in for his weekly check ups (to make sure your keeping up with everything and doing everything correctly). Well he wasn't happy with my dusting, my lack of mopping, and not detail vacuuming. So after he left my manager came in and looked around. She also was not happy and warned me to shape up or I'll get fired and thought I was just being lazy. I had to fill out some paperwork stating why I was getting written up and that this was my only warning, and blah blah blah. I didn't explain to my manager that I have depression and that it's been acting up. Because I don't like to tell jobs I have depression because I feel like they'll only think it's an excuse. And I'm really not looking for sympathy either. I am doing counseling with my therapist and am on medication and he recently upped my dosage. But I still feel depressed most days. The only time I can say I am even remotely content is when I am at home with my dog and 2 cats. I don't hate my job either. I chose this job because I also have anxiety. And working retail or doing customer service in general just gets me to overworked and anxious. This job is very chill (most of the time, now when the call center has holiday parties, it's not chill it's very much a lot of work to do and clean up).  \nHas this happened to anyone else? How do you manage your depression at work? I've also tried to get disability for my depression and anxiety but was denied. So getting on disability is not an option for me. Should I tell my boss I have depression? Would that really change anything?",

        "body": "\nHi, I\u2019m A, I\u2019ve talked about what happened to me when I was 6 in another post, if you wanna read it, you can check my profile, but it\u2019s a little bit disturbing.\n\n\nI\u2019ll get right into it, I can\u2019t get him out of my mind, even though I left my old school, I feel like he\u2019s still there with me, when I forget to turn a lightbulb on and I\u2019m completely in the dark, it makes me remember the dark room I was in, and I\u2019d feel him in the room with me, I could smell his scent, or hear him breathing and laughing, especially laughing, and I can see his figure, he looks like a shadow, it\u2019s like he\u2019s in front of me, watching me, or waiting for me to move, and when these things happen, my body just literally freezes, I cant move, I cant speak, even breathing gets hard, I literally stay in my bed till morning comes or till one of my family members open the door to get something from my room, but other than that, I stay frozen in place, staring at him and him staring at me and laughing, I\u2019m scared to move, whenever I moved when I was young and he didn\u2019t allow me to move, he would kick me in places that should not be kicked in. \n\nWhen I was 6, he used to bite my arm to get me to jump into the water since he was my swimming teacher, and now, I formed the habit of biting my arm really hard to the point of bleeding when I\u2019m stressed or don\u2019t wanna do something, and when I look at my arm after I bitten it, I remember everything, it flashes like a movie before my eyes\n\n\nAnd I cant look at any painting the same anymore, I cant, in the dark room I was in, there was a painting in the middle of the room, the man n the painting looked like a silhouette of someone or a shadow of someone, but the eyes didn\u2019t look like they matched at fucking all, the eyes of the man in the painting looked like they were cut out and replaced with his eyes, I swear. It was too dark for me to see, I could\u2019ve sworn I saw them blink or fucking move. Whenever I look at a painting, the eyes turn into the eyes I saw in the painting, I know it\u2019s an just my imagination, but I have nightmares of that painting every fucking day\n\nEverything fucking reminds me of him, everything, swimming pools, bite marks, broken light bulbs, dark rooms, paintings. I just cant fucking take it anymore, I don\u2019t want to see him every time I close my eyes, I don\u2019t want to\n\nWhen i close my eyes for even just a second, a image of a man appears, I can see his features, but I can\u2019t see them, idk how to explain it, and whenever I try to focus on seeing his features my brain starts hurting and I start to shiver, he looks like he\u2019s bending down and smiling at me, it\u2019s the same posture he used to do after he was done with me\n\n\n\n",

        "title": "Tired of feeling alone, but I'm afraid it's going to keep getting worse",
        "body": "I fucked up my marriage a year and a half ago.  My wife and I were married 6 years, worked at the same company (how we met), until she decided to stay home with our kids around August 2022.  A few months later, I came home from work and told her about my day, which consisted of working on an emerging issue.  It was complicated to test, because it required using a special test rig and a temperature chamber, so I worked with the rig responsible (a female) .\n\nBeing that my wife and I used to work together, work was a common discussion for us.  I was so excited to tell her about this new problem, so I told her when I got home.  She replied with \"when did you start having feelings for coworker?\"  I was and am still baffled.  I don't know how or why that was the conclusion she jumped to.  I don't and didn't have feelings for this coworker.  The problem is that the issue didn't stop there.  She continued to push the issue, never asking questions, always making accusations.  The accusations turned into arguments, because I wasn't admitting to what she 'knew' to be true.  The arguments led to yelling, cursing, and her telling me that if I wouldn't admit to this, that our marriage clearly wasn't important to me, and she would leave me.\n\nSo I told myself that if she needed me to be a bastard, so that we could work through this 'issue' and come out the other side, that I would do it.  So I lied and told her that it was true, and that I had feelings.  I've been talking with therapists about this and other issues, mostly about my childhood and how my father was a bully.  My father bullied me my whole childhood, I didn't get to talk and have a voice, I wasn't viewed as a person, and I learned to say or do whatever was needed to not make things worse.  I wish to god I had gone to therapy years ago and learned this about myself, but I didn't.  My wife is a very strong personality, which she learned from her mother.  She is also older than me.  I learned to just give in and let her lead.  So I lived this lie hoping that we could work through it and go back to 'normal' afterwards.  But she continued to make accusations that were unfounded, and the process repeated.  Her badgering me about what she 'knew' I thought, me not admitting to it, badgering continues, I relent.\n\nI tried multiple times to tell her what I did, but she refuses to accept it.  She doesn't want to listen to me, she can't trust what I say.  I did this to myself because I don't know how to handle adversity and have difficult conversations.  I'm learning now, but it's too late.  I love her with everything in my being, and she resents me.  When I get home from work she's cold and distant, because she 'knows' that I've been looking at other girls, thinking about having sex with them, thinking about being in relationships with them.  I can't handle it anymore.  I have literally one in-person friend, and I don't feel like I can discuss this with him because I was shitty and distant while he was suffering through his own divorce years ago.  I don't have an escape, we live with her parents and her sister.  The only thing keeping me alive right now is our kids.\n\nI know its my fault, I'm not trying to remove blame.  It just hurts so fucking much.  I gave everything to the relationship that I could and it wasn't enough.  It wasn't enough to keep her from thinking that I was straying, she was so sure.  I'm not enough as a person to keep someone happy, no matter how much I give.  We moved away from my family to be close to hers (across the street), when that house had water damage, we moved into her parents house, who also had her sister, husband, and 2 kids living in it.  We lived with them for a year while my wife and her sister fought like children and made everything so uncomfortable.  I made dinner for 10 people twice a week (at least) for the better part of a year.  I fixed up their house, I agreed to using my work vacation time to take vacations with her family twice a year, I am there for my kids, I worked in every way I could to show love to her and her family, and she still hates me.  I am nothing and I have nothing and I don't deserve to be a person.",

I know that's naive, and it's not how it works, but for a moment I just wish it was. I wish I didn't have these problems, and I wish I could just figure it out. Everyone else around me seems to have figured it out, but what do I know, maybe they don't know either. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe future and present feels daunting, I wish I could grab my belongings in a big sack, and just run away to a quiet corner of the world, and just live out the rest of my days. But I need money for that, and for money I need a job, which needs a degree, which leads me back here. I have no choice but to buckle down, and just go forward, but it feels very daunting at times, despite my friend and families support. I wish I could fully see in myself what they see in me, but the feeling comes and goes.\n\n May God bless you all, and help you in your hardships.\n\n\\-MNM.",

He's been on depression meds almost all of our relationship together and it has had enormous effects on our sex life. He is not able to get a full erection - often barely a semi. About 5 years ago, I was going to leave him as we had a lot of issues (sex was certainly one of the bigger ones, but there were also trust and control issues), but I stayed around because he proactively shared that he was going to try to get help. Here we are five years later and he's tried pumps, pills, soundwave therapy and says he's willing to try some kind of injections. Sounds painful. I'm at a point right now where I feel like I've been patient and understanding, but I don't see the situation improving.\n\n  \nAny guys suffering depression who are on meds and have had success with overcoming ED who can weigh in? I'm really at a point where I feel it might be best for my own mental health to leave, but want to see if there's anything else I can do to support or something else we can try.",

I am severely depressed and i see a dead end at the end of the tunnel. The thing is, i am 27, i am accomplished in my career, i am pursuing my master degree on scholarship, i have a lot of money for someone my age, i have been regarded as a physically attractive girl, i have two loving parents, i have travelled a lot, i have many friends who love me, but the failure of relationship and the prospect of dying alone haunt me so much.\n\nI have had 3 past boyfriends, i became close to someone last year and it failed. After each failure, i think of how far i am on the prospect of having a family. The hard truth is, i really want to get married and have a child, but i seem to fail. I thought i am the toxic and the bad one always but i have lowered the standard for some aspect but can't seem to work out. Now i am talking to no one and i feel lonely eventhough i feel surrounded by people. I got diagnosed with depression on January and i am on medication, but i know this is just a temporary fix. The horrifying thought continue to haunt me, to the point that i am doing self-harm and have suicidal thought at times like this:\n\n1. I know my friend's boyfriend is visiting and after 5 minutes of knowing that news, i had to go to my room because i had a major panic attack and i did try to hurt myself\n2. One of my closest friend is getting engaged in february, she sent me the picture, i replied with how happy i am, but that picture alone sent me overboard and i did not go out for 3 days out of my room, barely eating and doing self harm again\n\nI can't seem to use dating app anymore because it makes me so anxious, i run to self-sabotage. And i am tired when my parents point out how accomplished i am in every area of my life but when i look back it's so sad i have no one to celebrate my good moments with as my friends settle down and have their own significant other. I am so scared now to go back to my own country after master, i feel so ashamed in front of my other friends. I do want to commit suicide but i am a devoted Christian and i am still afraid of hell.",

Over the past 2-3 years i felt like making a change in myself and tried tk actively better myself. I lost 100 pounds and stopped being obese and overweight, formed new but isolated hobbies, connected deeply with friends, and continued working on my academic track in a field that make enough money that it won\u2019t be a problem like it has been all my life. Despite this, it feels like internally I\u2019ve been getting worse. Two years ago I started having epiphanies thinking how much more comforting it would be if I wasn\u2019t alive. A year ago I started to, in the background of the constant noise in my head, have formed a semi-active suicide plan. Now I have constant thoughts of suicide during the negative part of my mood swings. I\u2019ve been recently going to campus therapy and have a plan for a psychiatry visitin about a month, and am waiting on medicaid approval to find actual consistent mental health treatment outside of campus. It\u2019s felt like as I try to make myself into a generally better person, I only internally get worse. My intrusive thoughts become more vivid, louder in my brain. I think believe that constantly say they love me are using me, or that they hate me. I think I\u2019m worthless and unloveable. I have to lock myself in my room during the bad part of my mood swing and just lay still on my bed to get suicidal images to stop.\n\n Has anyone else got this? Is this normal? ",

        "body": "Hi there,\n\nThis is my first time posting. I have major depressive disorder, co-occurring with generalized anxiety, and cPTSD. \n\nAt work, I have contacted the disability coordinator, and I have spoken with HR. My symptoms are very severe and I am on medications, in therapy, and I am in the process of TMS therapy.\n\nSometimes I forget things. I experience bad brain fog. I will have random panic attacks, or if I forget to take my antidepressant, I can't remember anything from the day before, and I feel like I've been hit by a truck.\n\nTroubles aside, I have been a good employee. I get all of my work done every day. I have been so good and reliable that I have been assigned MORE work. For context, I am a legal assistant. I am a new employee and have been employed for four months, so sometimes I forget a step or make a mistake. Since I am a legal assistant, it's usually inconsequential, and fixable. However, my boss CONSTANTLY criticizes me. It's so bad I have panic attacks nearly daily.\n\nShe is aware of my situation. Disability services and HR have talked with her at length and my therapist has even written documentation with suggestions on how to speak with me and clarify issues. It's almost as if she just ignored them completely. She vacillates between praising me for my work ethic and ability, and criticizing me for the smallest thing (forgetting to enter time, WHICH WE CAN'T EVEN BILL SINCE WE ARE LAs) or forgetting to cc someone on an email.\n\nI always gracefully take responsibility for anything that happens, and take steps to mitigate it in the future. Today I am at my limit. Yesterday I was swamped with my work, and everyone else's. I worked intensely until the end of the day. Throughout that day, I was receiving constant emails from her criticizing me. I ignored it on account of being entirely too busy for her bullshit. \n\nThis morning, I logged on to work and the first thing I see is another email about entering a time slip. This time, for days I was physically sick. I hit my limit. I'm not sure if this person is being purposefully obtuse or if she is just an idiot. I am so angry, and I am so overwhelmed. \n\nOn top of that, I forgot my antidepressant yesterday so I had vivid nightmares, I can't remember anything about yesterday after work, and I feel like I have been run over. I have absolutely hit my limit. I don't know what to do anymore.\n\nI don't know if I should contact Disability again. I have been looking for new jobs but with no luck. I do not want to talk to her at all and I shouldn't be forced to. I am on the verge of another panic attack. I don't know how to cope and I feel frozen to the spot. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated, but thank you for letting me vent.",

And recently she apologized again after me being dry but she also was talking ab herself sjs, but for her she doesn't see that I saw her message cuz I did some little hack, also with others, I enjoy people's concern, but they aren't really concerned. There's one girl she said she's worried but she isn't really uhh, just short message but she wasn't evolved she was one of the ppl that HEAVILY talked about friend 1. Another friend, friend 2 let's say, she pushed me aside a Lott but that doesn't mean the others didn't. Friend 1 and 2 couldve done the most damage, possibly, and maybe another, or maybe them all. Friend 2 texted (online name)? Like maybe they were concerned idk whatever but now something something they now prob know I'm alive, aaaaa, ok I kinda wanna end it but ugh, maybe I'm tired of life, am I overreacting and just really unimportant? Am I just some garbage? An emotionless pissant?? Dude. Did she ever think of the amount of times I comforted her. Or any of them. I'm sick and tired. And Infact I am sick, bad health. I still haven't replied, they see that I didn't \"seen\" the message- but how depressed I felt again, you know that feeling, like, worthless, useless, iykyk man. Their all around the same age as me, and irl maybe people don't really like me. I'm a werido aren't i? I cried on my field trip, did anyone notice? I was on a Google meet with my brkthers old friend (a girl dw)  and she kinda made it better but I hate it so so so much. And I remember my friends mom couldve ruined my 12th bday, how hard I cried on that day lol. And especially how hard I cried when I felt miserable from that gc. It might be hard letting go but I might need to. I cant do this no more with that filthy.. okay I'm sorry just so yeah! Hahahhaha. What if I overdose?? Again?? Huh?! Aaah what if I go crazy crazy and take it all ohhh should I would I will I? This close \ud83d\udc4c bro omg. btw number of them prob didn't even apologize",

It doesn't really matter what we distract ourselves with...If we can JUST WAIT, then we will stay safe.\n\nI know it's hard but just for a moment, put all problems aside. Stop running scenarios and memories.\n\n\"I am here. I am now. I am safe\". Repeat. \n\nSTOP. Just freeze. Your mind and your body. Look around and find no current and immediate threat to your life.\n\nSlow your breath, breathe a bit deeper because a brain without oxygen doesn't do much rationalizing, only panicking. Fuller, slower breathes. Don\u2019t stop. \n\nRelax your tense muscles. You're in fight or flight, your body is geared up. We're \"un-gearing\" it.\n\nFind something in every color of the rainbow. Red.\nOrange. Yellow. Etc..\n\nFeel your feet on the floor. Really pay attention to them. Feel the floor, grass, shoes.\n\n\"I am here. I am now. I am safe\".\n\n\n\nLive in the immediate present moment as much as you can. The past is f\u2019d up, it's not safe there. The future seems insurmountable, uncertain, like you're only ever going to feel the way you do right now (which isn't true!!!). And how are we supposed to live if it's always that way. The future is filled with too many variables and uncertainties, it's not safe either. (You can worry about the future when you are finally stable and come out on the other side of this shit show.)\nOne day at a time can be way too much sometimes.\nFocus on the RIGHT NOW. Focus on calming your body and your mind will eventually follow. \nEven if that's all you do, all day every day. THAT'S OKAY!!! We hold ourselves to the highest expectation and we need to learn to give ourselves some grace during our healing journey. You've been through some traumatizing shit, I'm sure. This is how your mind and body survived. You're here now. And you're safe. And you will get through it. Just take care of your body the best you can. Try to love it even when you hate it. And the same thing goes for your mind.",

I cannot analyze and solve even the simplest of the problems. I cripple when I have to present something in the class. Thus, I have noticed a diminishing trend in my logical reasoning and therefore my studies have been downgraded.\n\nI have tried everything to get this solved and nothing seems to work. Now I've been feeling like everything that made me look smart was just a big sham.\n\nI feel dumb and genuinely ask for any advice on how I can turn the tide.

        "body": "My boyfriend (19M) and I, (20F) have been together for a year. Since the beginning of the relationship, I noticed he is very anxious and when stressed out, he tends to shut down. We have been working on communication and I think that he has improved with sharing his stresses and feelings with me. However, he still has a pessimistic outlook on life and gets really anxious when anything goes wrong, but doesn\u2019t really take active steps to fix it. For example, if he woke up feeling unwell it would stress him out immensely, but he wouldn\u2019t look online for advice or book an appointment, he\u2019d just tolerate it. I think it\u2019s noteworthy that he lost his father very suddenly during childhood, and went back to school without processing the death. For that reason, he doesn\u2019t want to speak to his mum about what he\u2019s going through, because he doesn\u2019t want to be a burden on her/feels like she has it worse than him. \nI myself have struggled with SH in the past and have ADHD so I am not unfamiliar to mental illness. I encourage him so often to see a counsellor, which is free via our university. He\u2019s convinced talking therapy doesn\u2019t work but I still encourage him to go. His family life is complicated so he won\u2019t speak to any of them. His friends are mainly from secondary so he doesn\u2019t really open up with them. I\u2019ve also suggested he starts a hobby, tries to reach out to people on his course to make friends, write a diary or say affirmations but idk if he\u2019s actually going to take my advice. \n\nI know we\u2019re young but I really think we have the potential to get married one day if he gets over his trauma and learns to love himself. His positive days are so amazing and he\u2019s the sweetest most charismatic person ever but when he becomes stressed he\u2019s like a different person. Any advice on how I can help him help himself? or what I can do?",
