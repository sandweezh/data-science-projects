The sinking feeling your heart gets right before your heart and soul shatter. Nothing like that millisecond where you lose you breath and feel a deep sadness. My sister is moving away with her kids. I've grown so attached to them that they are the only reason I've stuck around. They're moving to a whole other country and I'm so fucking devastated. I will at least have some good time to spend with them before then. I will make sure they keep those awesome memories with me. After they leave I'm going to embark on my own journey.

Sometimes life kicks your ass, I battled forever. But eventually the strongest soldiers fall. It wasn‚Äôt no one‚Äôs fault. Don‚Äôt feel like you could of done more. It‚Äôs my fault. That‚Äôs just how depression is. sometimes I want people just to ask me how I‚Äôm doing but when they do, I push them away. 

Even if  they try to say I was intoxicated I felt this way sober, you know what they say. ‚ÄúDrunk minds speaks sober thoughts.‚Äù 

It might sound hypocritical but just be there for someone you think is going through depression. Sometimes actually being there for someone even if they don‚Äôt know how to talk about it, just take them out. Because it‚Äôs better then being home alone when them thoughts creep in.

If your battling depression, I wish you the best üñ§ I know how hard it is to open up to people when they don‚Äôt really care. You start feeling like a burden, and people just talk shit.

Many have told me to seek God during these troubling times but I somehow just cannot connect to a religion or God.

1bmccbo,Its okay if you haven't figured out life yet. You aren't alone.,"I know it gets heavy sometimes.. Life takes the most unexpected turn and you are left wondering if its really worth waking up the next day. Sometimes, the person closest to you ends up betraying you.. Sometimes, you fail in something you were working so hard for.. Sometimes, life doesnt make sense at all.. No matter how much you try making things go your way, life hands you trouble one after another.. 
Trust me, I know how it feels to be surrounded by people yet feel lonely. You have to mask yourself and put on a fake smile so you dont have to explain how you are actually feeling . You feel like no one really understands you and they all surround you to get something from you and for their own selfishness. Its as if you are drifting away from this world and entering your own zone where no one really wants you for you. You try to convince yourself that people actually enjoy being with you but its as if you could smell their intentions from afar, your mind leads you to believe no one really cares about you just because one or two people betrayed your feelings.. I know the feeling of not being able to depend on anyone..
Trust me, I know how it feels like when you are betrayed and you dont get what you were trying so hard to fight for.. You cry yourself out and there is not a single night that you feel good about yourself.. This constant fear of failure and constant feeling of loneliness is turning you into someone you are not..
You feel the same dont you? This is a reminder that you arent alone with thoughts like that.. This makes two of us now imagine how many people are feeling the same? 
This is a reminder for you that not everyone is here to betray your feelings, some people want to change you and your life for good like your family.. dont let one person change your whole perspective on everybody..
This is a reminder that one or two failures from your hard-work isnt the end of your journey, its just a lesson to improve on what you are doing and focus on goals rather than results..
This is a reminder that you are doing great and you will get whatever you asked for- a good relationship, a healthy family and a successful life..

1bmaqme,(TW Abuse and sexual harassment) My mom is toxic and manipulative.,"(16M) Hey all, the title says it all. My mom is very toxic and manipulative to everyone in my family. (No physical abuse though.) she's constantly complaining about how bad her life is to everyone, even though her own destructiveness is her fault. she's often rude and demanding when asking for something. She'll start arguments over the stupidest things and start yelling at us. And often times when she does this, she always says ""You're just like your father."" who was abusive, stole stuff from us,  yelled at us, and threatened to harm, and kill us many times. me and none of my siblings are like that.

She also used to yell at me over very pointless and small things when I was very young. She also somewhat recently let one of her old friends into our house because she wanted a boyfriend. Because the first abusive one wasn't enough. The reason it was careless and shows she doesn't care for our safety is because, she knew he had a drinking and smoking addiction, was beaten as a child, and was very mentally ill. but she still decided to bring him into our home. And big surprise, he yelled at us all over nothing, threatened to kill me in my sleep, and out of nowhere when I was playing videogames with my brother, said to us: ""Do you guys watch pornography?"" When I stopped talking to my mom because of how toxic I was she tried to make me look crazy by saying I'm mentally ill. Which is so manipulative sounding. I just don't know what to do. I need to talk to her because I live with her. And I also need stuff like an ID, a drivers license and other things. I want to get out of the house and stop talking to her as soon as possible, because I can't stand it anymore. I wanted to ask if I should ever talk to her again if she changes, but I don't think she will. She's so ignorant and narcissistic, that I think just waiting for her to change is a mental health deathtrap.

1bm57jo,(24) M I can't live in this toxic environment ,"Almost three years ago, I moved into my grandmother's house. I was in a low place, this was before I was diagnosed with any mental illness. I was no longer self-supportive, and my family agreed to help me. It has been a very heartbreaking journey getting my life together. I claimed bankruptcy, had my car repossessed, and ran into legal trouble. I've had a job for the last two years, occasionally taking time off because I had to be admitted to the hospital four times for mental health issues. The last time, I was given Haldol and it turned out I was allergic. I had major side effects including anxiety, insomnia, depression, akathisia (feeling agitated and restless inside causing uncontrollable movements that offer no relief). My face and shoulder muscles would lock up, and I couldn't move. I pleaded with my ""doctor"" to take me off, but he kept saying this is what I needed, so I continued to take it, causing more intense side effects and reactions. Their solution was injecting me twice a day with more Haldol, Ativan, Benadryl, and Cogentin. I wasn't able to refuse the medication because they threatened me with refusing discharge until I complied with my treatment. I was discharged after 12 days and had to go to the emergency room three times that week from side effects I was still having from the Haldol. They finally put it in my file that I'm allergic. I was told the Haldol would be out of my system within six months. I went to three different psychologists over the last six months for help with the damage that drug did to me. Now, I still have uncontrollable movements and bad anxiety. My grandmother belives the symptoms are psychological, and reminds me constantly dispite three doctors saying otherwise My family isn't very understanding when it comes to mental illness, and it has caused a lot of problems. 

Things are changing for me now. My debts are paid off, I have my license back, I completed my probation, and I take my medication properly. I do not use drugs. Aside from my family, living situation, and transportation, I am the happiest I have ever felt in my life. I have an amazing girlfriend who has been there for me and supported me, and I love her son. He's five years old; his father is absent in his life, besides a facetime call once every few months. He's such a good kid, and I know what that feels like. I want to be there in his life and I want to begin our future together, but I cannot move in with them or afford a new apartment for the three of us. 

It has gotten to a point where my grandmother and I's relationship is close to being damaged beyond repair. I am not innocent, but I have suffered and worked my ass off to correct my mistakes. It's not healthy to constantly be looked at suspiciously; I'm constantly being treated as a burden (yes, I have been told I was to my face). It makes me feel horrible to bother anyone; it made me very antisocial, and now there's an issue with me just keeping to myself. I'm accused of things I didn't do constantly. I am treated like a child; my location is tracked, and there are notifications when I leave my house. I am not allowed pretty much anywhere without my family besides my girlfriend's or work. I'm being threatened with being sent to another facility even though I've passed drug tests and am taking my medication. I have no money saved because I have been giving 90% of my pay to my grandmother. I do not own a car, and my credit is very poor still. 

I have until Monday, the 25th, to find a new home or be sent to another institution. I'm not sure what to do; any advice would be great.",Prestigious_War2448,3,0,1711233773,depression

He strung me along for two years while dating someone else, wouldn‚Äôt let me go, and ultimately came crying to me about how he missed me and wasn‚Äôt over me, and then three weeks later said, jk I love my girlfriend. Needless to say, it made my mental health go down the toilet further and make me feel unloveable and worthless again when I was finally doing better.

Dating has been horrible. So many bad dates. The pickings are so slim that at this point I am entertaining men I‚Äôm not attracted to, because at least this singular guy is smitten with me, is nice to me, does not make me feel horrible. 

Everytime I do get a huge crush on a guy, turns out he‚Äôs married (great).

1bm4xjl,Is there a psychological explanation for this experience?,"Basically, since a young teen I believed I was worthless and should be punished for my existence. That I was the lowest of the low and everyone was above. I wasn't allowed to feel anger towards anyone or anything. Everything that went wrong in my life I would blame on myself even when logically I knew it couldn't have been my fault, I would find a way to blame myself. If my friend hurt my feelings, I would tell myself it was my fault because I deserved it, or that I was too sensitive or dramatic, and that I should be grateful to be their friend...  
And this anger would build until it was extreme and I would take it out on myself, punish myself. I wouldn't let myself hang out with people because I believed I would make their lives worse by being there. I didn't think I deserved to feel good because I was a terrible person and there was nothing good about me and I didn't deserve life but had to stay just because it would inconvenience people if I wasn't here, and death would mean I didn't have to suffer and I deserved to suffer. I was so upset all the time but when I cried I would punish myself for crying because I didn't deserve to cry since I should be grateful as I wasn't even going through anything and everything I was sad about was my own fault.  
I struggled with restricting and other physical behaviours which I 'had' to do when I felt sad to 'prove' I was struggling. Then I would end up binge eating which I would punish myself for. I didn't think I deserved support because 1. I was a bad person and 2. I was making everything up.  
I thought about ways I would physically be able to get help so that I had a reason to deserve kindness. Anytime someone was kind to me I had to punish myself because it meant I had manipulated them into thinking I deserved to be treated nicely. Sometimes I felt so much emotional pain it felt physical and I would internally beg for the suffering to end but then the other part of me would tell me I was being dramatic and nothing was wrong. I would walk in dangerous areas at night because I believed I deserved something bad to happen to me. I felt no punishment would justify what a terrible person I was.  
I limited myself from opportunities, I stopped doing things I enjoyed not because I didn't enjoy them but because I thought I didn't deserve to enjoy them and was ruining things for others by being there. I didn't put any work into my future because I didn't think I was capable of anything at all. I would even restrict sleep and water to punish myself for continuing to live a 'normal' life. Anytime I was complimented I felt such rage towards myself because I was so angry that those compliments couldn't be true. I wanted so badly to be anybody else, someone worthy of love.  
I wanted to do the things I loved so badly but I wouldn't let myself. I knew what I needed to do to be happy but I wasn't allowed. I told myself nobody cared about me, and then I'd feel sad that nobody did and then I'd get angry that I was sad over something that I deserved. I had rules like I always had to put others first and if I didn't then I had to be punished. It was like I was in an abusive relationship with myself.  
I was diagnosed with depression a few years later but I don't think it fits. From what I've read on depression the thought process is more like 'I feel so sad, nothing makes me happy. I wish it would stop. I don't want to be here, I need help.' not 'I feel so sad, no I don't I'm lying for attention. I should feel worse, I deserve to feel worse. I don't deserve help'.

I turn 36 in a little over a month and have absolutely nothing to show for my life.,"I grew up in a house with my 3 sisters and my mom. My dad was in the navy and was gone far more than he was home. Shortly after I turned 16, we found out my dad had been cheating on my mom for a while. The person he was seeing's daughter found our house phone number and called us to tell us where he was because she didn't like him. At 18, I watched someone I liked a great deal walk away on graduation night and realized I had gone the whole school year without even making an attempt. Just shy of 21, I was ghosted by someone I thought was a friend and who I saw as the older brother I didn't have growing up. The next couple of years I just don't remember at all. Then I got my dog, an all white husky and I loved that dog. Unfortunately she died 3 and a half years ago and the age of 8. They found a mass on her liver and she didn't make it through surgery. The same year she died I found a job that was tolerable. It was a small local restaurant, and I liked the people I worked for and with. I was there for 2 years. Unfortunately, due to health reasons, the owner had to close it down. I thought they were going to re-open, they even had me help remodel the restaurant a bit. I had to find out from someone I worked with that they changed plans and weren't re-opening and had rented the space out to other people. I have no interest in marriage or kids, and no long term plans for work. I have realized that I will never get to visit any of the places I would like to. Even if somehow I manage to make it to retirement it doesn't matter. My mom will be gone, I don't imagine my best friend will still be close (I don't want to hold him back in any way), the things I want to do and the places I want to go won't exist, and I'm not close with any of my sisters.

1bm3vlf,I wanna feel like myself again.,"I‚Äôm immensely unhappy in my current situation.  I live in a dead-end town with no opportunities, no green spaces, barely any shops left - half the people you see on the streets are drug addicts / homeless and all that‚Äôs left here to do is go to the pub basically. All my friends have either left the place or are just functioning alcoholics and very depressed themselves; I‚Äôve lived around alcoholics before and moved across the country alone at 17 to get away from that environment so it‚Äôs really hard for me to notice those patterns popping up in people here more and more. 

I feel like I need a change of scenery and a change of faces, but there‚Äôs nobody left in this town and after a change of scenery I know I‚Äôd end up back in the same rut here which completely demotivates me. 

My closest friend moved away for university two towns over to a place with much more investment and much more to do, as a result I have spent a lot of time there recently and made a lot of semi-close friendships there through this closest friend, but that friend has now got a partner meaning I no longer have a place to stay when I go up there and if I go out I have to leave while everyone else is still enjoying themselves. (Them getting a partner has left me a bit worse for wear; I value platonic relationships a lot more than romantic ones and I‚Äôve gone through the cycle of forming a close relationship with someone who then gets a partner and has less time for me leaving me feeling abandoned many times)  It makes me feel invisible, like my presence isn‚Äôt necessary and that they‚Äôd all be just as happy without me there, and also because I don‚Äôt live there I‚Äôm not able to develop that same level of closeness with these friends as they do with each other, which makes me feel like putting effort into the friendships is pointless. It‚Äôs also really hard to find people who want to spend time doing things that aren‚Äôt alcohol-based activities, and as a person who dislikes drinking culture and going out this puts another barrier on me being able to nourish these friendships. I think alcohol is a trigger for my depressive mood swings and suicidal ideations (shocking since alcohol is a depressant) but when in this situations there‚Äôs a societal feeling of peer pressure that leads me to drink and then break down and beat myself up for it. There was a time around 6-9 months ago when I would be so overjoyed with going out everyday to see people, because I enjoyed the people and I enjoyed the environment, and now I‚Äôm just withdrawn mentally - I can‚Äôt see a point in going out to see people whom I‚Äôm not exactly fully close with / can‚Äôt fully be myself around and to be in drinking environments I don‚Äôt really want to be in at all; since things are lined up for me to leave this town in September I don‚Äôt see any worth in entertaining this friendships that I know are just gonna fall apart when I move. 

Speaking of the move, it‚Äôs obviously good on one hand to get away from here but I‚Äôll be moving to a new place again, starting over again, in a completely different part of the country once again, and this is filling me with uneasy and uncertainty which makes me want to draw back, because even though this place is absolute hell it‚Äôs a hell I know and I‚Äôm used to, and so many things could go right when I move but so many things could also go wrong - I may not be able to find new friendships and new people I can be myself around again, and I feel like I should just kill myself to spare future me the anguish, even though I know I have people around me who love and care about me and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm overthinking this whole thing. I‚Äôve never really had a support system around me locally before and I feel like it‚Äôs all crumbling and I‚Äôm terrified for that and I‚Äôve ended up pulling away from them)

1bm3thb,Success has robbed my ‚Äòwhy‚Äô ,"I‚Äôve always been a very goal oriented, disciplined and ambitious person. Depression was something I‚Äôve felt happens to people who experience severe hardship not those who succeed in what many would consider the pursuit of happiness. 

After university I didn‚Äôt get the job I wanted. But took that as extra motivation and after 3 years did achieve what I always saw myself doing: a suit and tie job at a prestigious firm. As a junior starting out it meant long hours, proving yourself and beating others in an up or out culture. As a senior the work load only grew and the weeks, months and years were stressful but rewarding. I‚Äôve learned a lot and grew to genuinely like my job and get quite good at it. The success came as being recognized as one of the global top achievers for multiple years in a row. Which came with a promotion, salary increases and bonuses. Allowing me to pay off my student debt, buy a nice house in a good neighborhood and afford a luxury car. Besides work I got married to my best friend. My wife is amazing. Equally ambitious, intelligent and strikingly beautiful. We have two dogs and our home life is great. 

In short: I‚Äôm exactly where I pictured myself to be in my 40‚Äôs but in reality most days I feel empty and don‚Äôt see the why or the purpose of living. My thoughts are extremely negative all the time. Nothing is ever good enough. My mood swings are constant and all over the place. At work I‚Äôve mostly perfected a professional ‚Äòmask‚Äô. Which I want to let go at home but then feel like my bad vibes are effecting my wife and I don‚Äôt want her to start feeling bad as well. So I don‚Äôt really have anywhere to go with this as most of my friends and family feel that I should be grateful with all I‚Äôve got and achieved in life. Adding to the shame and guilt I feel by not feeling any joy about it at all. 

I‚Äôve tried multiple psychologists in the past as well as mental health aid from the hospital and been diagnosed as depressed. The professionals were never able to help me because of being in their joint opinion a highly functional person without a direct external cause for the depression such as work or family life. Which left me feeling even more misunderstood and alone. As asking for help to begin with was a major hurdle for me to overcome in the first place. The final solution were anti depression pills after I began developing suicidal tendencies. They were horrible and make you feel like an empty shell. Dulling all negative emotions, but also anything positive. I‚Äôm still here though so I guess I should give the pills some credit. 

Currently off medications and much better in control of recognizing flare-ups in my depression. But unsure how much longer I can keep this up. With the negative thoughts and no sense of direction I feel like I‚Äôm losing the battle against my own mind. Also, I feel terrible for being this way and for my wife to be around me. I want to be the better husband she deserves but am at a loss as to how.

1bm2lt6,Depression progressing - unusual hallucinations ,"A close relative has had major depression for several years now. It's been pretty severe, including suicidal periods. He currently is on ssris. (Unfortunately only started those when things got really bad. Went many years entirety untreated. They don't really work well. He's not as suicidal as he have been, but that's basically all. ) All that time he had big time sleeping issues. Either sleeping for 20h or being awake for sometimes 2-3 nights in a row unable to fall asleep. Periodically with intense hyper real nightmares. In those nightmares he would recurringly see three creatures. He'd be in a dark, hellish basement like place, together with them. They speak a language he can't understand but he sorta telepathically knows they are talking about evil, death and hell. And even tho they do not physically threaten him he feels extreme anxiety and helplessness facing them. Perfectly aware this is a dream, he is yet unable to wake up even when he panics and feels his heartbeat going through the roof. 
Not too long ago the nightmares mostly stopped. But then he started having more panic attacks in real life. He says, he feels it coming and then all senses feel enhanced, hearing and seeing especially. Everything is super loud and sharp. And then the panic attack comes. Often he starts shaking and can't speak or move. Often this aphatic shaking state remains for an hour or even several hours. Often he has no memory whatsoever of those. For example he went on a trip with his wife, got one of those attacs entering the plane and doesn't not remember flying, riding the bus, checking in, about 5 hours, just erased from memory. 

Recently he started having hallucinations being awake. He sees the beings from his nightmares clearly together with him in the room. Being wide awake. It's not shadows. He can see them very clear. He isn't affraid of them anymore. They do not try to kill or severely harm him. But they do tease him, touch him, annoy him and laugh about it. They do not speak to him. He can hear them speak to each other though in a language he can't understand. He says, it's impossible to ignore them, and even though they don't threaten him, the teasing is very annoying and whenever he encounters them, on top of all, it feels like they suck the energy out of him. As soon as the visions are over he is so weak, ha can't move or speak and falls asleep on the spot.

Whenever I read about psychotic depression people say it's auditory hallucinations or shadows and that the voices or figures talk to them about suicide or worthlessness. But his hallucinations do not seem to fit that theme. Also whenever he has those visions he is aware of them being hallucinations (it feels real but he knows they are not. Probably because they are creatures that do not resemble people or animals in the real world). 
Has anyone had similar experiences? 
What helped? Certain pills? Certain type of therapy? I'm trying to help but no one really understands what's going on and we don't know where to start.

1bm39oi,Life is unfortunately no fairytale,"People hold a lot of secrets and they are so great at it to the point where you'd think that it was just human nature. Me on the other hand I hold my secrets because I have no one I can tell. Loneliness it's like a plague that infest the most broken people. You know they tell you that when you get older your friends start to decrease but it's never for certain. When it comes to me it was inevitable because unfortunately I was one of those broken people. Sometimes I ask myself is it better to be lonely and surrounded by people who will never really know you or is it better to be lonely and have no one. I feel like I spend my days wasting time and waiting and waiting and waiting but I'm not sure what I'm waiting for.  
Am I waiting to be happy? Am I waiting for something to change? Am I waiting for my depression and anxiety to become a thing of the past? Am I waiting for me to change? Or am I waiting for my death? I've never been afraid of it, death that is. In fact I've only been fascinated by it. Sometimes I wish I was a kid who got more hugs and who heard their say they love them. But this is real life and it's not a fairy tale so there's no Prince charming coming to save me and I have to save myself. The only question is how. So I ask myself how to end up like this and how did I end up here. I need to leave here in order for me to thrive in order for me to live. Here is torture, here is pain, here is a constant reminder of I am the why I am. But here is supposed to be home, here was supposed to be the place where I feel safe in the world. But it's not because like I said this is real life and this is no fairy tale for me. Sometimes I wish it was though because then would be easier to be the girl locked in a tower and the handsome knight who's probably white comes and saves her but I would have to be white as well and I would have to have the blonde hair, not nappy nigga hair and blue eyes not the brown ones. My story was already tainted from the beginning not to say that my life made any easier. I'm so tired of saving myself and I'm so tired of fighting for me and I'm so tired of forgiving people after they hurt me and I'm so tired of being me. It's so easy for people to judge each other because they don't walk in the same shoes and they don't see the same views but I wish that I was not different from you. When I think of my future I don't see a happy ending, I see years of healing and years of finding myself and years of learning to love myself. I'm currently in the process of college, working, looking for an apartment, losing weight, fixing my eating disorder, taking medicines for my depression, anxiety and whatever else, paying my debt, working on learning to speak up, fixing my physical health, fixing my life patterns, finding myself and etc. And somehow in the process of all of that I'm supposed to love myself. If I said I give up then I look like the bad guy or the girl who died because she couldn't take it or the girl who left her whole family and loved ones behind or just another statistic. There aren't enough words to explain, to comprehend and to say, that would express how exhausted and drained and depressed I truly am.

we‚Äôve decided to stay friends until otherwise, because i enjoy them and i want them in my life. we had a beautiful, happy relationship that was very healthy, and it all went to shit literally overnight. i‚Äôm at a point where i know that my mood and my feelings are a huge factor into why i started feeling this way, but there‚Äôs no other reason to why i‚Äôm feeling this way.

myself, but i feel so stuck in one spot because i‚Äôm desperately trying to figure out if i still have feelings for him or not. i feel like it‚Äôs the only thing i can focus on right now and i don‚Äôt know why. if i really didn‚Äôt love him anymore, why would i be so caught up in trying to find out what‚Äôs wrong with me?

more important info: this HAS happened before, but four years ago when i was 16. i had been dating my first boyfriend for a year and a half give or take. i was completely fine one day and anxious about loving him the next. in his case, it did go away, and i felt fine about him afterwards, but i‚Äôve gone back and forth about it for the two months this has been happening. 

is this because i‚Äôve been depressed, or have a i fallen out of love with him? a combination of both? maybe i just left the honeymoon phase and now i have no motivation to continue a relationship because of my depression. i have no clue anymore :‚Äô)

similar stories/situations very very welcome!

tl;dr ‚Äî my relationship either ended because i stopped loving my ex, or because I‚Äôll depressed, or who knows maybe a combination of both.

How in the hell would depression be treated if it‚Äôs a side effect of a medication? My psychiatrist isn‚Äôt helpful.

1bm2rmw,Will I ever feel like myself again?,"I never was a particularly happy person but last year has been rough on my mental health and something I'm experiencing now (that I haven't experienced during other low points in my life) is that I don't truly feel like myself anymore. May be because while I turned 23, I haven't accomplished any of the goals I thought I would accomplish at that age. I feel like I was the happiest at 21 y/o (22 sucked, 23 will either suck or be the start of recovery. Or both)

I used to be passionate about books and movies (now mostly apathetic), excited to learn sewing and knitting (now I get annoyed and frustrated), loved long walks in nature (now I only go to get some fresh air and physical activity, it's like a chore). Even music doesn't bring me joy anymore, I just use it (on headphones) to tune out noises like the neighbors talking too loudly or the sounds of roadwork outside.

It's not only mental stuff. I lost weight because of my bad eating habits and while I've never considered myself beautiful now I actually kind of hate how my face looks and how some of my clothing looks visibly too baggy. That's not the face I've grown used to seeing in the mirror over the years. I actually started eating regularly and cooking nutritional meals because of that so I guess that's one positive thing.

It feels like there's a warped version of me inhabiting my body, that's the best description of it.

It took me a while to get along with everyone, but things are going well now.  

The others got me into smoking and drinking, which at the time felt like a blessing. I got drunk everytime I had the chance. It was a huge relief. The numbness is like heaven.  
  
Anyways, we had a stoner in our group. She wasn't easy to get along with but she let me take a couple of hits of her joints from time to time, which was enough for me.  
  
I somehow managed to get addicted after my first high.  
I can't really describe the feeling, there's nothing that I could compare it to. But, It's like a dream. Time slows down, the world around me turns into background noise, and my head is filled with this fog that just washes away all my thoughts.  
  
I swear, it's the best feeling I've ever had in my life.  
Honestly, I don't understand how people can live without drugs.  
  
When I'm sober, I feel like a living corpse. I just breathe, eat, sleep and wait for the day to be over. Like an animal. I'm basically on autopilot. I have no goals, no aspirations, no hobbies, no future, nothing. I have no reason to keep going.   
(I could elaborate on this for about 6 hours, but that's a story for another time)
  
I don't want to think, I don't want to feel, I don't want to live.

Fuck, I don't know where I'm going with this.  
Just venting, I guess.

I stay up late to have alone time, I work an shifts when he has days off so I don't have to see him. I have no friends because he accuses me of cheating and flirting with everyone.

I don‚Äôt recall me doing this when I was depressed myself, so I‚Äôm curious as to if this is something any of you can relate to and if so what causes this for you, or if she really is just trying to ghost me, although I‚Äôm not in doubt at all that she is depressed. I‚Äôm sorry that this post comes off as very egoistical, I really do want to support her however I can, but I am worried about asking her about why she is ignoring me and seeming clingy, and fear what consequences it would have on our relationship - as well as my depression coming back if I don‚Äôt try to handle the issue soon, as it really is making me feel ignored and has been messing with my selfworth a lot recently

In advance thanks a lot for any help! :-)

1blxnxd,I wish I didn't exist,"I'm not suicidal or anything. I just wish I didn't exist. Or I wish I lead a different life. I feel trapped. I'm too sensitive, too little and too much. I feel alone. I wish someone could save me from this rut I'm stuck in. I know things will be better one day but it's a lot of pain right now, more pain than I can handle. I don't have any support. I know I've come farther than I thought was possible but there's still a long way to go. And the process is so tiring. I want to go off the grid, change my identity and eveything about myself, start fresh. I wish it was as easy as just walking up one day and changing my life but I'm stuck here with too many responsibilities. I just wish I had a shoulder to cry on, to tell me it's okay to feel what I'm feeling and to hold space for me. But perhaps I'm asking for too much. I feel like a burden and I so want to scream out that this is not me. But I'll just be screaming into a void and I'm afraid no one will hear me. All this just when I started taking better care of myself. I'm being pulled apart from all corners and I feel like I don't even exist as a person. I'm just a robot expected to be in 10 places at once. Everyone's disappointed with me at the end of the day for not doing enough. I'm trying to juggle everything but there's only so much I can do. There is only so much I can do. 

I yearn for a better day. I yearn to wake up and not dread the day. I yearn to just live a life, my life. But until then, I wish I just didn't exist. ",Spirited-Attempt-520,2,1,1711214824,depression
1blxmso,"I know it used to be different, or at least I had more hope that it could be","    I feel like some of the best times of my life were when the most traumatic incidents were happening to me, and afterwards, all I ever remember is thinking that I wanted them to happen, over and over and over again. I never thought of them as being traumatic in the moment, but they ruined my perception of reality and what normal things feel like and I haven‚Äôt been able to enjoy normalcy. 

   A lot of my first sexual experiences were online with older men when I was a minor, I guess I just didn‚Äôt realize how heightened the experience was because I was younger, and because it was so taboo. That started being the only thing that I favor, and now that I‚Äôve been in adult for some time I realize that those experiences are not normal and they‚Äôre very heightened in a way that you‚Äôre doing something wrong and I‚Äôve noticed that that alone can be a huge sexual attraction just because it‚Äôs wrong just because it‚Äôs shameful and because you shouldn‚Äôt and I didn‚Äôt realize that that was a huge factor. Now that everything is not off-limits anymore and I can do whatever I want as far as consensual sexual relations, I don‚Äôt feel that attraction anymore. Also getting use to people and experiences. 

   None of it as special or as romantic as I ever thought it‚Äôd be. It‚Äôs been no more a huge letdown after fantasizing about it, my entire childhood, because it calmed me down and it was one of my only skills as much as that‚Äôs not a good thing it‚Äôs all I found that worked. 
     Anyway after a few my relationships that went very south and hurt very bad, I was not myself. When I got into my current relationship a year and a half ago I kept expecting to feel a lot more than I ever actually have and I always questioned if it was just me comparing my very heightened experiences to a very normal experience or he‚Äôs become too normal to me or if I don‚Äôt feel anymore at all. 
      I got very depressed after the last relationship that I was in. Starting this one, I wasn‚Äôt on good terms with myself, and I also hadn‚Äôt had nearly enough time I needed to heal from my past ex. I had so much joy for that relationship and to learn that it was a lie and of course I was being groomed I just, don‚Äôt understand why reality is bitter because it makes me feel more dead inside then when I was being straight up lied to.

      I believed everything and it was blissful and now I live quite the same reality that I was wanting so I got what I wanted, but the emotional connection is not there and as far as relationship problems go, I‚Äôve hit the lottery with them and not because of who I‚Äôm with but because of my needs because my partner doesn‚Äôt particularly shine in those areas so it takes extra work on top of the long hours he‚Äôs already gone. It makes me feel bad for asking so I‚Äôve gotten to the point where I‚Äôve stopped fighting for what I want in the relationship. 
       It doesn‚Äôt help that I found out that I was pregnant pretty recently and of course he was way happier about it than I was. But totally looks over the neglect I feel and the depression aspect like the kid is gonna help it go away to an extent. 
     I feel like I‚Äôm dying as a person my identity is gone. I‚Äôm not sure who I am anymore because my favorite versions of myself are all in the past and I don‚Äôt feel like I can be myself the way that I should anymore. I look at myself in the mirror and I‚Äôm not proud anymore, I‚Äôve lost interest in nearly everything I‚Äôve ever enjoyed, except for superficial things that remind me of memories that I wish I was having, with lots of love. The only thing that makes me happy is just fantasizing about things that will guarantee physical, emotional and spiritual connection. 
     My partner is the only person that I interact with during most days except for calling my mom or my dad. On days that we are fighting, I have to wait until the next day or the next day after that to get any kind of emotional connection again. I also have no girlfriends and no plans to go back to school. I just kind of sit in the house all day and rot. 
     Some days all I want is to be young again to experience all the best days of my life when my hope was at the highest and my dreams felt more possible and way less scary.

*Cross posted to r/SuicideWatch*

Throwaway account because I don't want to reduce the possibility of the people in my life finding this.

Unsure of why I am even posting this but after 20 years of depression and anxiety, I have let it get to far and I can't escape from it.

I lost my job in the beginning of January, later that month I attempted suicide but couldn't even get that right.

In February I lost my relationship of 11 years because in my stupidity I waited to long to propose and work on myself, not for lack of wanting to though, but actually because I couldn't get past my fear of not being enough.

With the the relationship I lost the home, car, etc.

I'm broke and in debt. This is after working on average 60+ hour weeks for 10 years.

That plus an old illness popping up with full avengeance among other things, I just don't have any fight left in me.

I look in the mirror and see the problem, a burden and a failure. I believe that I am a waste of resources and am now browsing the internet with no will to live left.

More info: I have been on antidepressants (my second time) since January. I called the suicide line in my country today, it didn't help at all. If you're wondering about what I might be planning, the answer is yes.

Hi Reddit. I‚Äôve been in depression for the past 12 years. Sometimes things get a bit better depending on the meds I‚Äôm taking and the current life circumstances and stress levels. Other times, you know‚Ä¶.
My husband is very supportive but no matter how I try to explain things which I admit I probably do in a muddled way at best (how I‚Äôm feeling, what I can do and cannot do, etc.) he remains clueless (how can you be depressed? You were fine the other day/ why don‚Äôt you do this or that). It is frustrating for both of us and on top of all the rest taking a toll.
Do you know of an article that explains in layman‚Äôs terms what depression is and what the sufferers go through?
Of course I tried to find a source but got overwhelmed (ADHD + currently in the deep dark üòû)

1blvoin,Watching ‚ÄúDrive My Car‚Äù made me realise many things,"People are too complex; you can‚Äôt understand them. For every decision and every move they make, there are billions of reasons that are unknown to us. The mind has a subconscious which is untapped by any philosophy or science. So don‚Äôt even try. But that also means we ourselves are complex. It takes an entire lifetime to resolve and understand these hidden emotions. So let‚Äôs be a little brave and admit them as they are, not getting bothered by anything else.

The first thing is to accept life as it is. Accept yourself as you are. Don‚Äôt feel guilty even when you have messed up things. Don‚Äôt get too low or too high for something you are not part of. You are alone in the end. Life is pointless. You came here alone and you are going to die alone. Yes, even your lover will leave your hand when they bury/cremate you.

1bluvdu,My little brother ,"My mother just told me that she wished I wasn't there and If I wanted to go I could.
It's not the first time she said something like that, it happens a lot and she also told me in the past that if I wanted to die I could.
 
I wish I could, but I have a weakness and it's my little brother.

For context, I am an 18 years old girl, and I have a 10 year old brother. Me and my mother do not have the same view in life. Perhaps because of religion and culture, (she is African), she has a different way of thinking. I am not saying that people of certain religious backgrounds and ethnicity are bad, but you know some cultures put different types of view on people.

When I was twelve I started hurting myself, and the problem is that my mother said that I was acting white and that if I wanted to die I should and could, it's free. She doesn't believe in depression Only when it's here, and she has a lot of negative views on some people because of her religion, which is contradictory because she is supposed to not judge...

When my brother was born, I had to take care of him a lot. I was eight when I had to take care of him at night after school while my mom worked. I know we haven't had the easiest life, I grew up in Congo and it wasn't easy then we went in Europe, Belgium... now we are in France. And  she did worked a lot for us, now I have my own room and a house, I know we were even homeless once, but does that mean I deserve those words?

I started working hard, really hard at school as if giving myself a point in life...I also really love art, which is the only moment I feel happy.. but I feel so hopeless. If it wasn't for my brother, I'd go away, and perhaps I'd let myself die. 

I don't want to leave him alone with her. I'm really tired, all my efforts are worth nothing. I rarely eat, I don't sleep.... Sometimes, I wish my brother didn't exist, because I would be able to go in peace if it wasn't for him.

The worst part is, I feel as if I am not allowed to feel this. I am not allowed to feel sad because people have worse, I am not allowed to feel sad because we have lived worse in the past. I finally have a home and I'm in a pretty free land with good people, I'm not allowed to feel this..

1blugmy,How to help a friend,"Hello.
I (23f) dated a guy (23m) for a bit under a year. We were long distance and even though we broke up, I would say our relationship was a really nice one. He opened himself to me since the beginning about his struggles with mental health. It was quite bad. He had suicidal thoughts since a young age because of many things that happened in his teen years: like being badly bullied, girls asking him out as a joke, his parents way of parenting, etc. He grew up to become a really insecure person. While we were dating and after he confessed that he didn‚Äôt feel good enough to deserve ‚Äúsomeone like me‚Äù in his life. 
His parents opinions have always had a big toll on him. From his dad telling him ‚Äúmen do not cry ‚Äú ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not depressed, your friends are feeding you wrong ideas‚Äù ‚Äúthere‚Äôs not such as thing as depression‚Äù and his mom is quite similar but more on the over protective type. During our relationship both would treat me as a gold digger and his mom would tell him any chance she could get that or relationship was deemed to fail, that he should date other people and I wouldn‚Äôt find out, that I‚Äôm toxic, that he should date a real European girl (I‚Äôm from Latin america) etc. Hearing all this opinions + his insecurities led to our breakup. 

Months later we started talking again as friends, and I came to the realization that his view of relationships has become really worrisome. I always knew he didnt have the right view of what a healthy relationship meant. But it has gotten worse, it was never to this extent. He thinks the only way to be loved is to feel loved by another person (a relationship). He has become obsessed with finding another person, and that if he doesn‚Äôt get into a relationship before 30, that means he‚Äôs a failure. I asked him what would he do if he‚Äôs single by 30, and he admitted he would kill himself. I genuinely didn‚Äôt expect that answer. He recently got a crush, and if she rejects him, he will spiral badly again, which I‚Äôm 100% it will happen. He gets crushes to fill his lack of self love. Thats also why his friend and I agree that he won‚Äôt ever have a healthy relationship till he gets help, he‚Äôs sadly really easy to manipulate. To feel loved and included he will follow what any person would say to him. Because of this new mentality is also also why he felt the need to ‚Äúblock me‚Äù out of his mind before, cause he started thinking his clock was tickling on getting over our relationship and trying to find another gf before 30 (during a bit after the breakup he became ‚Äúmean‚Äù but later apologized and admitted it was because that‚Äôs how he was treated before, and he thought that‚Äôs how it was supposed to be)

At least, for this time. I won‚Äôt leave him alone. I can‚Äôt and I genuinely won‚Äôt. I‚Äôm the only person he fully trusts to send me messages when he‚Äôs feeling bad. And I have no problem with answering to his good morning messages that give him quite comfort. I do think I would obviously love it if eventuality, getting the help he needs, he won‚Äôt need as much as reassurance he needs from me.  And will be able of living the life he deserves. He‚Äôs not a bad person, but he doesn‚Äôt see it himself. He‚Äôs great. He genuinely made me really happy, and I‚Äôm sure he also makes all of his friends happy too. 

He does have friends that have noticed his bad mental health, however he doesn‚Äôt open up to them fully. I would say I know 85% of the situation, while he tells his friends around 30%. Only one of them I would say knows around 60%. He looks at her like a sister. After we broke up I messaged her to please check on him, and now we talk from time to time, not only about my friend but we also just found each other quite nice to talk to. She knows about his struggles, and has always been open to hear him. In general his friends are really nice, and have always tried to comfort him any chance they can, they said they also noticed ‚Äúsomething was going on‚Äù since the moment they met him. 

Because of how bad his mentality has come, him saying he will kill himself if he doesn‚Äôt date till 30. (One month and a half ago he also wrote what would have been his ‚Äúsuicide note‚Äù. I only found out later when he confessed he felt bad for having people worried for him, cause he wrote it in the note along with writting that he felt bad for being a baggage for me, I could never see him that way). 

The question is. I don‚Äôt know if I should, at least, make his closest friend aware of this. She doesn‚Äôt tell him when we talk about him, me neither.  When we talk about him is mostly us checking up on him. If I was living close I would maybe keep it to myself and try to make him get the help he needs on my own, but I don‚Äôt live close. His friends (his closest friend) do. They do have suggested him to try get some help and even tried to talk to the uni staff about it. I‚Äôm not sure if I should tell his closest friend a better idea of how bad things are getting. Since she, again, lives closer and I think could be of greater help for someone that‚Äôs actually physically close to know about it. 

I‚Äôll probably get comments saying to just let him be, and is not my responsibility, but I won‚Äôt leave him during this time. 

I recently sent him a care package and it arrived today. So he‚Äôll go to pick it up. From time to time I also send little details. Like a hand warmer, sweets, etc. I don‚Äôt want him to forget he‚Äôs not alone.
The care package contains: find Waldo images that I printed, origami tutorials and color paper I cut myself, sticker by number that I found of his favourite flower (he also fell into game and porn addiction, and says he‚Äôs stuck in this cycle, I gave the suggestion to try hobbies, and he won‚Äôt do it till someone gives him all he needs, that why I added that), QR code to fonts that I bought since he studies graphic design, chocolates for his friends and salty treats for him since he doesn‚Äôt like sweets, a beanie (he lost the one I gifted him a year ago, and felt really really really bad about it, so I checked multiple stores to find the same one, and I did find it !), good luck charms from my country, etc 

(Sorry for any grammar or any mistake I general. I‚Äôm writing this fast before starting my day at my job) ",throwaway00660066,0,1,1711206687,depression
1blugj6,Body Shame,"I'm 17m and I'm so ashamed of my body. I feel so guilty for being a man because I feel like the only thing people think guys want is sex. 

Really what I want, if I get married someday, is to have a deep emotional connection with my wife. To know her and to be known by her. I want to sleep next to her, cook together, and raise our kids together. I want to love, be committed to, and serve my wife. I want all of this.... along with sharing sex with her. Am I so terrible for wanting that? 

I just feel so disgusting for wanting sex. It's not the only thing I want, but I feel shame either way. I know it's just the culture, and that girls are taught to hide it, but I've grown up with the idea that girls don't want sex. That girls don't desire that and they don't get temptations. 

What I want is romantic and meaningful but I just feel like an animal. 

I just feel like I'm never going to be understood and/or never find a wife who will want me. I'm very much afraid that my wife will get over me or bored of me and won't want me anymore.

I am too concious of myself and when I make some mistake I immediately start seeing around me if somebody notices me and as I have turned 18 I can see many changes happening in me as a result I am no longer innocent like others like whenever something bad happens around me I am become too much aware of it and it feels very bad while others don't even notice it and remain happy like I used to be before in childhood. Also I don't like sports like others. I have too much dark interests unlike everyone else. Sometimes I think all this is due to me being born in 16 December which is the worse date of the year as I have seen people born in December are worse people neither they look good nor they have talents.

I always feel real ashamed when i have to ask for help and be so vulnerable and i told him about that multiple times. Im Just real sensitive and rarely ask for anything, except im really in need, like needing water. 

I was already really dehydrated, and i asked him while he was already laying in bed. Before that we had talked a bit and snuggled, so He was awake but just real tired. I then asked him, If he could get me a water, and he got really annoyed and complained that he didnt want to get up. I was really hurt by his reaction and didnt know how to respond. 

I went silent and he misunderstood my reaction with being angry, thats when He started getting real Defensive and how He was Just tired and what i expected of him and so on. I got really frustrated and just told him i get it myself, but he He already got up to bring me some water.  I didnt really feel like drinking that, since it was so annoying for him to Help me. 

I just thought he would be more understanding. I feel so hurt and alone with my problems, that its creating a big distance between us. I tried to talk to him and he apologized, but he doesnt get why it was hurting me.

I have no goals, no social life, no desire to do anything. I'm also Muslim and of pakistani decent. I'm addicted to porn and have been since I was 13 , it gives me the littlest drop of dopamine I have to get through the day. I'm a second year in college right now with only 30 credits, no clue what to major in (I went from Electrical Engineering, to Economics, and then transferred to another school that takes 1.5 hours on public transportation). I live in NYC so no way I can drive to my school. I did architecture for a semester and did complete garbage. Now I'm studying Construction management. My dad wants to do Construction after retirement and decided to purse the same degree as me, as well as my cousin. (Crazy right?) Now whenever I say I'm struggling with a class or it seems too hard, he's like ""i work full time and got an A in those classes, so you can do it too"", or ""youre not putting in the effort."" The truth is, fuck this life. Why should i try for anything at this point. I also work part time, and my job requires me to be a full time student, otherwise I have to resign. I withdrew from 3 classes last semester so I am on academic probation from my job. This semester I took some bullshit classes to get my 12 credits and keep my job. But there seems to be no end. I'm miserable, and my parents won't let me take a break from school otherwise I have to move out. I literally have to be in school right now. I've been told ""it doesn't matter if it takes you 10 years you're getting this degree."" I've been asked by my bosses what my hobbies are since they know I'm not doing well in school, and i have no clue how to answer this question. All the money i make goes to paying tuition as I do not get any financial aid. I have no interests or desires to do anything. I'm eventually gonna run out of easy classes to take and stay full time. This is my 3rd time taking calculus and im probably gonna fail again. The only thing I do if I'm not at work or school is in my room and watch porn,  not even because of the attraction anymore, it just gives me some comfort. Or I scroll through Instagram reels.  Ive tried to quit porn many many times, but go back to it after a week at most. Its ramadan and i still fall into this habit after sunset. My dad and uncles and their friends bring up marriage to me and it always pisses me off as I can't and am so depressed to the point where I'm not really attracted to anyone anymore. Why the fuck would I get married right now? I understand it's part of my religion but no way.  If I could get a job where I could make like 55k and never advance and do it the rest of my life, I'd do it. I have so much to say but idk what.

I now stay inside all day and have an addiction to shitty imageboards, fanfiction sites, discord, and reddit. Whenever i scroll i feel like a part of my brain is wasting away yet i can't stop. I keep my curtains shut so i don't have to see what's going on outside as i might start wanting to go out or feel like i'm missing something. I have no friends irl and only interact with people online for discord game jams, fantasy anime leauge and anime discussion on imageboards. I can't even play online games with voice chat because the idea of speaking to people through audio makes me feel horribly sick and lightheaded. I spent my 17th birthday crying alone quietly because i'm one year closer to having to get up and take responsibility for things which i never want to do. I hate interacting with people who aren't my family because they all backstab you and think they know what's best for you and I have no real interest in anything they have to say. I've grown to much prefer characters and concepts because they cant change suddenly, or be snarky. I also hate the responsibility of having to speak to someone daily as it makes me feel burnt out pretty much instantly plus i struggle with giving people advice and generally understanding them. I've ended up pushing away so many people because socialisation makes me extremely exhausted. Theres no point in having friends if i grow to dislike being around them or get burnt out and can't hang out. For the good of the other person i just push them away.

But here I am, sitting on my couch. Cuddled into blankets, having a hundred tasks to be done, questioning if my earlier much loved hobby is still my hobby as I don't enjoy it anymore. I don't know when I showered the last time. 
If I weren't with people yesterday I won't have eaten anything besides the chocolate next to me. But I gained weight, I'm sad. The package I really need to send stands patiently in my kitchen. I already send it but I came back and I'm overwhelmed. I have to be more careful this time. But it's expensive and complicated. I don't want that anymore.

I'm reflecting how I lived my life the last weeks ... And now I see all the little signs which tried to tell me ""Caution! Depression incoming! Be careful."" But I ran past them. Directly into ‚ú®the depression ‚ú®.

The end.

No matter what I do I don't fit in with people only a few people I know I am close with but even then I feel there is something lacking.

I did regretful things as a teen that I can't seemt I shake off.

My house is a mess and no matter how much I try and clean it there is always a surplus of stuff I need or want but physically don't know how to store. I'm not even a hoarder. 

My luck with women is pretty thin I don't know how to approach them or talk. Or even talk to people generally. 

I get so angry or frustrated now with everything.

My family as much as it's small love me very much but are too overprotective and don't let me to be free as much. I'm 19. I'm a young guy I want to do things but my parents are just so l strict. I know they care but I just want some more freedom.

I'm ugly people have blocked me for seeing what I look like. I am going gym and I mostly enjoy it but I get so downhearted when I see others who look brilliant or I feel so small compared to them. Even online or in real life I see people and think fuck why can't I be like that. Why was I born ugly. Even my personality hurts to be around and I'm unsure how to change it.

1blq2db,me and gf both have depression,"My girlfriend and I have been together for half a year. When we first met, I was in the worst phase of my life. At the point, I was struggling with coming out with my family, financial constraints and rentals. I constantly felt trapped and helpless, and had been suicidal for 3 months on end. Because of past trauma, my girlfriend was one of a few people who could relate to me. I could reach out to her for sympathy, understanding. She was both a listening ear and someone to bounce off ideas for solutions.

Before I asked her out, I made it a point to start therapy because I did not want my gf to be doing all the emotional labour in this relationship and picking after my slack.

My therapist did caution me against starting a relationship given how I had been going through countless changes and am need of time to settle down and adapt to my own life. However, I just went ahead with the confession thinking that I did not want to miss out the beautiful things in life.

Recently I have had a lot of improvements in processing my trauma, but whenever I shared it with my gf, it would be taken as misery instead of strides. For example, I was sharing with her today how past few nights I could not sleep because I was up re-examining how tough it was for me back in school while I was still closeted. I did not allow myself space and time to acknowledge how hard it was until 7 years later because only now I am safe enough to actually relive those moments.

I graduated college with an engineering degree & got married spring of 2033. I now work a desk job doing a lot of environmental government paperwork and it is boring. Fine for now but not for the forever. Not sure what next steps are. Hubby & I plan on no kids till 30.

I was scrolling reddit mindlessly, aimlessly, & read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/s/yNMAilPtCj) (r/depression does not allow cross posts). It made me realize I am depressed. 

I thought I was depression proof. I started douloxotine for anxiety Fall 2023 & have already had my dosage increased. It helps with racing thoughts so much. It works much better than Zoloft, which I tried previously. I thought that I was depression proof because I was on anti-depressants.

When I wasn‚Äôt on them, I would ball my eyes out for hours, want to die, self-harm, etc. Now that I‚Äôm on them, I do none of those things! My husband is much less stressed too, because I am stable.

I mean‚Ä¶ I do feel barely motivated to do work, eat healthy nurishing food, excercise, go to work, see family, see friends, cook, play videogames‚Ä¶ I just kinda scroll Reddit now & go down rabbit holes. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ fine. I feel like I barely noticed 1/4 of 2024 go past.

- that I need to start drinking (at least) 2 of my 40oz bottles of water per day.

Also conscious that i might have mental health issues.. nothing feels right anymore. I have friends and activities that I could keep myself occupied with but I choose to do none of that shit and rot in bed the whole day. Do I think about ending my life? Yes. But can I go through with it? No, because I know I have people around me whom I would hurt‚Ä¶ but if I had the chance to give away my life to someone who deserves it even less than I do, I'd gladly do it because I believe they would see it as a second chance.

1blpc8s,"How do I overcome this? 28M, lonely and possibly depressed","I'm currently battling a bout of loneliness for the first time in my life. I have been living away from my family for over two years now, they only live half an hour away but I've never felt emotionally safe to express myself around my parents, except to my brother - who is very busy with work lately and I don't have time to talk to him.

1. I just changed jobs, from a hybrid situation where I got to see my colleagues in the office two days a week - to a job where I need to work a night shift with remote colleagues who work in a timezone with a 15 hour difference. Confined to my home 5 days a week with no physical interaction.

2. In the past two years of living away from my family, at least I've still had housemates. First was my cousin, then my ex girlfriend. When my ex and I broke up, she lived in my house for another 8 months till she found a place of her own. I'm now living in a 3-bedroom apartment fully on my own, with nobody to talk to and a boring job that keeps me at my desk. It pays alright and I have more time to hit the gym, so that's my only consolation.

3. I find myself in a blossoming new relationship in the last two months, but my girlfriend is long-distance. We Facetime nearly everyday, but she's normally exhausted after a long day at her work and will be coming back to my city (her home city) in a couple of weeks. Besides her, I have nothing else to be excited about in my life. I know how important self-love is, and to not rely on one person for happiness, so this is not at all a good thing.

4. My old friends have all grown apart, and I am forcing myself to maintain ties with them by having random catch-ups, going out for drinks, or just texting them to say hi. But I can sense that they're either not interested in entertaining me or simply too busy with their own lives. I regret taking for granted the years when I was close to them, to not forge a stronger bond over time. I say this because I feel that most of my friendships have expired since we don't share similar interests/experiences/humour anymore like we used to, and the only ""friends"" I relate to are now the people I work with.

5. I have started going for therapy but it's not been convincing. I need to talk to people who understand me well, and the only people who can - are my brother and my ex. My brother is too busy and when I tried talking to my ex (we're on good terms, platonically), she's always going off about her new boyfriend and of course I'm not keen to listen to my ex about the person she replaced me with.


I know that I'm not alone, and that many others are battling the same things here, if not worse. For the record, I AM NOT SUICIDAL, not at all. But I do cry myself to sleep on some nights.

It was never like this, I used to be full of life in my late-teens and early-20s. People knew me for being the one who brings others together and always has my OWN shit together. I'm known for being independent, intelligent, financially responsible, and very stoic. I'm too afraid to come clean to anyone and ruin that perfect image that they have of me.

once she was done getting ready, we were able to leave and picked up a few more people to go to the mosque with us. my parents kept on calling me while we were picking people up and asking me where i am and i kept on telling them the same thing over and over. i sent them the link of the mosque and my dad said he‚Äôs going to pick me up. i was rlly confused because i was going to the MOSQUE. once me and my friends reached the mosque my dad was already there waiting to pick me up and it was just bc the mosque had different islamic beliefs and my dad called them non muslims like dawg i just wanted the free food and then i would go home but idk that was so crazy for me.

I knew it was the guy and played along without doing anything too far, like I'd make a joke or something. And then I'd ghost him.

Then he started yapping and now all I can think about is bashing his head into concrete until he dies or gets brain damage.

Frankly as 28 F and someone with a large gap in my work resume. I just want a job. Not many opportunities in my city and being also rejected from some of them, it quite hurts.

Yeah, I am suffering from depression and I never was a social being either. Something was so repulsive about me, I could never really form friendships or keep aquitances. 

It was either bullying, being ignored or treated with disdain. Present time, I am mostly alone with no drive or motivation to improve. 

I wonder if anyone else can relate to what I said. I wanted to start learning again to improve, but I am in a fog and I cannot move forward.

It is easy to prove why I am so stupid to. Smart people are confident with what they believe, they can solve problems on their own. They are capable of showing others how great of a human being they are (and good for them, smart people deserve the recognition) and therefore can easily get others to praise them constantly.

 I on the other hand is not even close. I am never confident in my beliefs, always doubting my logic or reasoning since I can never be 100% sure (whereas others are clearly 100% sure since they can boast so confidently without hesitation).

1bllptx,"Hit rock bottom, no friends, severe depression","I've been suffering from severe depression for over a year. I'm feeling suicidal and hopeless..  
  
Last year, I hit rock bottom and everything fell apart.  
  
It all started when I made the biggest mistake of my life. I was working in a very stressful job and it impacted my mental health so badly and it started taking a toll on my physical health as well and I decided to quit. After quitting my job, I continued working as a freelancer and took a leap of faith to start my own business despite having no savings. I used my credit cards and my sole trader income tax to fund my business, I worked very hard and did everything I could and I failed.. and now I'm left with credit card debts with a high interest and tax debt which I'm struggling to pay since I'm drowning in credit card debts. This is the root cause of my depression.  
  
And then my girlfriend of 5 years left me as I was financially unstable.. I don't blame her.. she deserves someone better and stable. After the breakup, my depressions got so much worse. She was my first love, we lived together for 4 years, and it was the only serious relationship I had.  
Shortly after, I got into an accident and broke my right leg, had to get a surgery, and I couldn't walk for months.  
  
And then, my best friend of 10 years (and my only friend) who has always been there since we were teenagers ended up dating my ex. I'm completely shattered and we haven't talked again since.. this guy is literally the only person I had left in my life (I have family but they are all back home, I'm an immigrant overseas). I don't know if could ever make a new friend with such a strong bond like I had with this guy, or even make a new friend in general.  
  
Due to this series of f\*\*ked up events, I'm so broken and messed up in the head now.  
I'm 30 y/o, with 38k in debt, have no friends and no social life whatsoever. I'm still working as a freelancer so I just work from home and have no colleagues, literally 0 human interaction.  
I tried to get a debt consolidation loan because the credit card interest rate is brutal (23%) so I wanted to get a debt consolidation loan at least with a lower interest rate it would be much more manageable, but didn't get approved because I'm working as a freelancer and I have no assets. I tried everything but there seems to be no way out..  
  
I just feel so tired of living this way.. I used to be such a happy person... and now I feel like I've been in the darkness for so long that I don't even remember the last time I felt happy, like genuinely smiling and laughing, it's been so so long :( and I really miss that feeling. And now I'm carrying so much mental burdens and I started having suicidal thoughts and it really scares me.. I wish I could just sleep and never wake up again..

I dropped out of highschool and things downward spiraled into extreme isolation. I was never an ambitious kid. It wasn't until I suffered severe humiliation by one of my family members that I began to push myself forward. I got busy but was always a bit off mentally. I would do embarrassing things that were deemed awkward. I had a horrible time communicating. All those years I spent away from society came back to hurt me. Although I got through it, I find myself in limerence. Somehow unable to believe anything is real.  In a way I am lonely. I miss the rotting stage where I could just pretend I had no responsibilities. Sometimes although I feel so much love for my family and friends, a switch goes off and I hate everyone. I always feel like nobody understands me. I still feel like I'm at the cusp of reaching adulthood despite being so behind. I never had a real solid job. In a way I am scared. Scared of never living and working endlessly to distract myself. I know I should be happy to have accomplished so much but I feel so detached.

I also keep thinking about how there were so many resources wasted on me and how I don‚Äôt deserve to live because of certain health conditions I have (among other things) and how I wish I could transfer all of that to a healthy person so that it is not just a waste of food, money, and a college degree. 

but I keep thinking about things I could do to prep people for when I‚Äôm gone, possible ways of doing it, and what their reactions would be. timing too - do I drift away slowly and hope no one really notices? should I stage it as a runaway? do I actually just run away and try to start a new life? I just can‚Äôt stop picturing a world that I am no longer apart of. sometimes when I do things, I randomly think about how this might be the last time I do them and the quote I heard about, ‚Äúone time you do something or see someone will be the last, but at the time you probably won‚Äôt know it‚Äù. sometimes I feel apathetic, but sometimes I feel genuinely sad.

1bljwak,Why am I like this?,"Been in love with the same girl for almost 2 years. I haven‚Äôt gone a single day without thinking of her. I never told her how I felt. It‚Äôs too late now because she doesn‚Äôt even remember who I am. Which is understandable because we literally only talked one time. She also lives states away from me. I met her on Omegle when I was 14. Over a week after my birthday. I turn 16 in 2 months. We talked for probably an hour about all kinds of stuff. I even remember some things. She talked about Indiana because she lives there and about how some former Colts players children lived in a house in her neighborhood. I talked to her about Philadelphia because I live about an hour away from there. I can‚Äôt remember all that much unfortunately. But around the end of the conversation. She had the best smile I‚Äôve ever seen. She said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre cute‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt really respond because at the time I had no idea I was in love yet. She then gave me her Instagram and left quickly because her dad came home. I messaged her the next day saying ‚ÄúHi it‚Äôs me from Omegle‚Äù. She never responded or read the message. But I was able to figure out she didn‚Äôt really use Instagram at the time because she only had a few post and wasn‚Äôt online. But I guess she forgot about me since she never thought to check the next day. Still not knowing I was in love, I shrugged it off and moved on till about a few weeks later. I was scrolling through her posts and  I had a weird feeling I never felt before. Deep down I knew I was in love, but I kept denying it to myself because I didn‚Äôt want love at the time. Till eventually that ‚Äúweird feeling‚Äù became strong love. Life felt amazing for the first time in a long time. I never had the courage to try and message her again, I just looked at her pictures all day and listened to music. Sometime around February I think, I had the courage to do it. I said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been awhile since we talked, you probably don‚Äôt even remember me‚Äù. This time, she actually responded almost instantly. She responded with the most hurtful word ever. ‚Äúok‚Äù. I was just in shock. I never responded and don‚Äôt plan to. I just dropped my phone and walked away from it. For the first time ever, I felt my heart sink and break. It was around 7pm and it was a school night so I got a shower. I remember actually hitting the floor and crying saying quietly ‚ÄúI love her‚Äù. So cringe of me. I was mentally broken for a very long time I can‚Äôt remember how long. But eventually, I actually got over it. Till sometime in early 2023 I‚Äôd say. I was looking through my old messages and saw our conversation. And guess what happened? Yup, back in love. It‚Äôs now March 23rd, 2024 and I haven‚Äôt gone a single day without thinking about her. She started posting again all kinds of pictures with her and friends. Earlier this month, I couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore. I made like 4 or 5 portraits of her in like 2 hours with text saying how much I love her. I know what area she lives in, her school, her sport, her friends, her parents names and photos, even her grandmother. I looked through every social media app known to man and found a couple more apps she uses. I have filled my camera roll with like 70 photos of her recently. I used google maps to see how far of a drive it is from my house to her area. It‚Äôs about 11 hours. I have debated many times running away to see her, but I never will of course. I have become a complete stalker. I have lost myself worse than ever this time. I also don‚Äôt fear she won‚Äôt like me, it just because she lives so far away. I‚Äôm not bragging I swear but I‚Äôm not an ugly person. I‚Äôve been asked out many times but I never liked them back. I also learned she‚Äôs in a grade higher than me. I‚Äôm a freshmen and she‚Äôs a sophomore. Only because I was held back when I was younger because I didn‚Äôt do my work as a kid. We would have been in the same grade. But it‚Äôs not a huge difference. I‚Äôve also been having really bad thoughts of ending my life over her. I am so pathetic I know. But that‚Äôs not the worst part. I had a thought to myself thinking ‚ÄúIf I can‚Äôt be in love with her, no one can‚Äù. I won‚Äôt go into detail about this because it still scares me of what my other thoughts were about what I said there. I‚Äôve had so many panic attacks and mental breakdowns over her. I remember about a week after I met her, I told myself I‚Äôd never be able to see her. I then had my first ever mental breakdown. Lots of people I feel like would just say to me ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just your first love‚Äù that is true, but this is almost more than that. Now I‚Äôm aware I have never met her in real life, but I know for a fact she is such a great person. I still remember the date, day and time the conversation ended, from my memory. May 27th, 2022 10:34 pm. I‚Äôll never forget this date ever. I really only remember this because I took a screenshot of her Instagram she typed in the chat and the both of us on camera. I can write so much more honestly to this story there‚Äôs so much more and it just gets worse to where I am today. I hope someone can try and help me. I‚Äôve tried hotlines and I‚Äôm always out on hold for way too long. I hate asking for help, but I‚Äôm desperate at this point. I‚Äôve also developed anger issues lately due to all of this. I am also not using my name or anything like that because I don‚Äôt want people to recognize me, even though idk anyone who uses this platform that I know. Lots of people look up to me and I don‚Äôt want them to see me like this. I‚Äôve got a really bright future ahead of me and a great personality, but none of this matters at the moment. When I think of her, I‚Äôm a nobody. Those are only some of my inner thoughts that I have. 
Anyways like I was saying, someone please help me. I don‚Äôt want therapy because I don‚Äôt want my parents to see who I really have been for the past 2 years. I hope someone can comment. ",ChancePush5335,0,3,1711168946,depression

Looking at them now, a lot of people were using the app for urgent care...I wasn't so that's why I'm posting this here to find out other experiences with their mental health options.

I signed up, went through the whole thing of downloading the app & talking to the healthcare professional. This was $50 up front. I couldn't tell if the woman I was talking to was AI or not?? She texted me a wall of text after about 30 seconds lol bc I know it had to be copy+paste or AI. That's fine and all, but something was just off, especially when it came to sounding like a real human. All the texts were formatted like chaptgpt lmao. But she had a picture & credentials so who knows.

Anyway she ended up telling me I'm not fit for the program bc my PCP is prescribing me ambien and I can re-enroll later. She didn't even give me the option to tell her I'd be willing to give up the ambien if she was able to prescribe me something else. So basically she told me bye after maybe only 15 minutes.

Hi Reddit, quarter life crisis here. I‚Äôll keep this extremely short and to the point. I got married, very young and very quickly in my marriage is falling apart just as fast as it happened. 99% chance I am going to file for divorce, how many people do you know that are divorced at 23 years old. My job is very cool and I like it but I‚Äôve really had some uncomfortable issues with my boss in the work environment lately. I am thinking of switching jobs. I had a bunch of interviews and I‚Äôm still not sure if I want to leave or not. I am still in my hometown where I‚Äôve lived on my life, and I do not have a good reputation, because in the past, I have not chosen to be a good person and struggled very severely with mental health issues and lack of self-awareness. I need to get out of my hometown. I want to restart my life. I am only halfway done with a bachelors degree and I think I want to finish that so that I can have a career I‚Äôm proud of before I‚Äôm too old. My life needs to change if you were in a situation like mine what would you do? Obviously I have the answers I need inside, but have you ever felt like your whole entire life needs to change in order for you to be the person that you‚Äôre meant to be? Do you know how uncomfortable I feel right now in every aspect of my life? It‚Äôs not easy to start over especially when you‚Äôre poor and have no friends or family to support you.

I've tried going to the gym but haven't been able to stick with it. I'm very busy and I hate myself and I never expected to live past 21 so I never took care of myself, nor did my parents instill working out or good eating as a regular habit of mine (they've been extremely stressed and regret not doing it, it's not like they're lazy or anything like that, honestly they're amazing people).

1bleph8,And people say you're not alone. But sometimes you are.,"I'm about to talk about my struggles in finding help. Please don't read if I might accidentally trigger you.

Yesterday I filled out one of the DBT diary cards honestly. You know what I really don't understand? Nowhere you go seems to understand that there's a difference between having suicidal ideation thoughts and actively acting on them.

How can I heal if you don't allow me to be honest? And I having those thoughts? Yeah have had them for a very long time. Shortly after I turned 18 I believe.

But if you dare tell any medical professional that they're going to immediately want to toss you in the loony bin or take the liability off of their hands. They approached me after the group therapy was over. And asked me about why I had filled the diary card out the way I did.

And I was honest. I said I have all these feelings in my head and I have no one to talk to about them. Group therapy isn't meant to be individual therapy, they made that clear at the start of class. And my therapist and psychiatrist have all but given up on me. Basically telling me to seek help on my own somewhere else. No I'm not joking.

So I told the group therapist yeah I feel really abandoned. I've got all these thoughts building up in my head and nowhere for them to go. But that doesn't mean I'm going to act on them. I told them I really could use help finding a therapist. It's hard to find the right one and sometimes that takes several tries to find that person that works well with you.

I feel so downhearted. Because as soon as I told them I wasn't a threat to myself and they wouldn't be liable for me feeling the way I am, they just said well very good then be on your way. No regards to what I was asking for. Which was please help me find a new therapist. Is this not a mental health clinic?

So when people say that there is help out there I'm failing to believe it. I mean here I am sticking my neck out asking for help and it seems to me all they care about is liability. Well if she actively hurts herself who's responsible? Well even if I were going to actively hurt myself, I certainly wouldn't tell anybody that. That part just baffles me. Don't most people who have a plan to hurt themselves avoid doing that?

No that is not what I'm doing. I'm asking for help because I don't want to feel this way. But alas I see I am alone. There isn't any help out there that I have found yet. It's hard.",Lijey_Cat,1,0,1711153231,depression

I can't get myself out of bed in the morning before school, if i can shower before forcing myself out of my home i'm shocked at myself and i just want to sleep during class because i struggle with insomnia as well. I try n hit the gym after school but i'm severly overwhelmed by my day at school and tend to just go home, feel guilty then end up bingeing. It's like 2am rn and I'm laying on the floor of my room because my bed is overwhelming my senses (idek why) and I'm just crying because tomorrow is going to be the same, over and over again. 
Anyway i'm not rly seeking advice or anything bc my therapist is great and ion have any suicidal thoughts or anything, i just needed to vent

1blejn2,My nightmares are affecting my mental health,"Read this at your own risk, I might be descriptive of some slightly gruesome stuff idk

I have really vivid dreams, I can taste things and remember those tastes like I have eaten that food in real life (I am still looking for a certain kind of bread that tastes similar to one I had in a dream lol), I can smell things and feel breezes and everything and I remember it as long as I remember that part of the dream. But it also means that I feel physical pain, and lately I have been having nightmares about being kidnapped and abused or tortured (or even SA:d), and the torture is not mild. Last night I had three consecutive dreams with the same storyline but I got kidnapped by different people two times and experienced pain in all three. One example of the things that happened in my dream last night was getting holes drilled all the way down to the roots of all my teeth, and although the pain is not on the level it would be in real life, it still hurts really bad. As I remember it, the pain was similar to one I felt during a dentist appointment that left me scared of dentists.

I wake up with no pain in my body, but I become mentally affected. It adds to my distress, and I can imagine the pain when I think about the dreams. It stresses me out and I hate going to sleep knowing that I might get tortured in my dreams again. Ik it might sound dumb or lame but I have no idea where those dreams come from and why I have them, I have had similar dreams for most of what I remember of my life, but never often enough for it to feel like an issue.

I hope these nightmares stop soon, I usually don‚Äôt have those when I am not stressed, but they add to my stress and mental weight, and right now sleep is turning into another point of stress for me instead of letting me rest and it is not helping my already unstable mind :/

Just a lil rant, it doesn‚Äôt feel like something that can just be fixed but if anyone else experiences this I would love to know, because I feel so alone with it and don‚Äôt know how to cope with them

1ble42w,I am depressed at 13,"This is my second time ever really venting, ive tried a therapist but i have to get my parents involved with it so i just didn't. I've been having these thoughts ever since I was around 10-13 and ever sice my parents divorce my depression has become ""active"". 

Around when I was 11 or 12 I had this big group of online friends that lasted 2 years. We had this big minecraft world that we named caca town. I loved everything about, every day I would be so excited to be on talking with them. Then there was this event that ruined everything. This one guy joined and told lies to everyone. No one believed it but after a while it started to get into one of their skins. It dug into them and they didn't know what to think, then he eventually believed it then left. I don't know what happened to him but they said he killed himself. After that ""he""was kicked out for ruining everything. After that I started getting these thoughts about how I could of done more to fix this, how I could of saved him. I still remeber the world like it happened tomorrow. I eventually just pushed all of them away so that I don't ruin their creation any more. My first betrayal was him joining and doing this.

Then at school I had some money that some of my friends knew about. I didn't think anything about it until one of them took it. He wasn't good at lying. It was only 60$ but I knew I should stay away from him. So I pushed him away. My second betrayal.

Then after a while before the second time I had made this other group of online friends. It started out super good. Everything was perfect, it was all I ever wanted. After a while i started to feel off about the new people that joined, but I just thought that It was me thinking about the past, so I let them join. After a while people started going with them. Is my group not fun? Is it me? I don't know. But everyone started to disband. Me and 3 other people were really left. Then it was 2 other. I thought this was all I needed so I didn't really do anything about it. Then one of my friends wanted to talk to the other friend that disbanded, it sounded like he wanted to talk to him, it really did. So i eventually got him to talk to him. This was my worst mistake, this time it was really my fault. He said the worst things to him, telling him about how much he hated him how much he felt like he was a disappointment. I was struck in the heart, my closest friend saying this to him. He was so sad after this. So I pushed every one away, it's the thing I'm best at üòÉ. I cried myself to sleep that day. Then he talks to me like nothing happened. I'm disgusted at myself and him. My third betrayal.

I  didn't have a good relationship with my mom. I never really did, all she did was work, Water the garden, and was on her phone. She really only took care of us when she has to. There was also these times when my dad told me about things she did in the past, these were hard to believe because she basically was barely in my life. But now I believe about anything bad he says because I heard her talking about the things my dad said about her. My dad tried getting a divorce with her a long time ago but didn't have enough evidence so nothing really happened. Now I just don't really talk to her any more. Everything was going normally. I thought things were gong better. But then my dad told me about something my did a while ago. I won't be telling what he said but I was devastated. How could you not care about us, and do bad things. The divorce is still being figured out but I know where I'm going. I feel disgusted when i talk to her, she's the one person next to me that i want dead. Fourth betrayal?

There is also this other event that was completely my fault but I won't be saying.

All I can think about is how I could have done better, how things could have changed if I did something else. I cared too much, now I don't care about anything.

I'm only alive because of my dad. I love him for taking care of us and loving us. I just can't make him sad by killing myself, I would be such a bigger disappointment then I already am. My siblings also can't have a dead oldest brother, who would they look up too? They cant, they would be looking down at my grave.

Now I'm just pushing everything into my big sad balloon, keeping everything hidden from the people I know. I've spent so long making and designing my sad balloon. But eventually it will pop, because you can never fill a balloon with too much air.",Basic-Middle3043,3,12,1711151665,depression

I have tried everything over the years to get over my thoughts. Drugs, therapy, seeing a psychiatrist, etc. 
Today, I finally give up.
I wake up everyday and ball my eyes out. Even if I try to resist my thoughts or distract myself from them, one way or another, the thoughts of being molested, photographed, and beat into submission by my father come running into my head.
All I was born for was to be used as a fuck doll for a few years and I can‚Äôt live with that fact in my head anymore. I can‚Äôt love myself knowing that my birth served no purpose other than to please my father sexually. I want to die every minute of everyday, even during the happy times in life. Smoking weed is the only thing that keep me from committing, and after being robbed and violently kicked out of my house by my father a few years back for attempting to stop the abuse, I havnt been sober a minute since. I don‚Äôt get high anymore due to my tolerance, and now that even THAT coping mechanism isn‚Äôt working I truly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm gonna get through this month.

1bldj7p,Weird situation with dreams,"Hello, I wanted to ask you something, especially for those who take medication for depression. 
Right now, I'm taking Miravil 50mg for around 3 weeks, not really seeing any good results right now but that's not exactly what I'm worried about. Also, I don't know if it will be of any importance, but before Miravil I was taking another medication, but it also didn't work. 
Anyway, the problem I struggle with right now, other than all the other stuff, is my weird dreaming situation. Lately I've been having really realistic dreams, but I feel like they have gotten worse. After waking up I have no idea if a day passed or not, even if my dream had some bizarre elements, it all feels real. I feel like I can't trust my memories, I also feel a bit detached from reality.
Is it anything serious? Should I tell my psychiatrist? Did anyone of you struggle with something similar, and if so, was it anything serious? (not asking you to diagnose me, just curious about the causes for other people.)

I‚Äôm 24 years old & waiting on my disability claim to go through. I was living with my mom but some heavy shit went down & one of my older brothers offered me to move in with him & his family knowing I had no income and was waiting for my disability to get approved.

She‚Äôs helped me so much mentally since I got her in 2020 from a couple who just didn‚Äôt want her anymore. She deserves the best life ever. Well, she‚Äôs running out of dog food and I have no income. A kind lady on Facebook offered to buy me some if I could pick it up from her house 14 mins away from where I live. My brother drives through the town she is in on his way home from work every day, so I asked him if he could pick it up for me on his way home but he said no. So I‚Äôm not really sure what to do. I‚Äôve been struggling so hard since I was 13, which I had to raise myself from then till I was 18. I try so hard to keep my head floating above the water but every day it just goes deeper. None of my siblings will help me out, I don‚Äôt ask for money at all. I usually just find stuff I need on free sites on Facebook but I can‚Äôt ever get a ride to pick anything up because they all clearly make up excuses not to take me or grab it when they‚Äôre in that specific town.

1blcj17,Lost myself,"(TW Self-harm and suicidal thoughts mention)

Does depression ever go away? I've had periods of time where things feel okay, and I feel like I've reached the surface of the water and I know where things are and what to do. And it's been nearly a year since I last engaged in self-harm. And I do not feel suicidal anymore, because I have things I want to do and people I want to see. But ever so often these depressing feelings or whatever just come back. This empty sort of feeling in my chest and the feeling that I need to cry- but I'm unable to. The hole in my chest is always there. Taking the path of just giving up on life and rotting away until the end of my life is always somewhere in there. I do not want to be alone with my thoughts, yet socializing is so frustrating and consumes all of my energy.

I've lost track of time. Or rather, I lost it a long time ago. The days just merge together. I can't put my finger on when things happened and I keep forgetting everything that happens. I turn 18 later this year which makes me a legal adult. The depressive episodes have been on and off since I was in elementary. Still, it feels like a couple of years ago.

 There's this feeling I'm never really present, as well. My physical body is there, but I still don't feel like I'm really *there*..? Like I'm just watching stuff happen. And responding on autopilot. Is it even me controlling my own body?

Yet there's still some kind of comfort to this loneliness, this emptiness- where I'm isolated from everyone else. On days where I feel better, I don't know who I am. I don't know who I am without my sadness. I can't identify myself and who I am as a person. What do I bring to people who know me? Who am I in their life? My mind is a mess...

1bl9et1,Help me with this,"

Hi peeps, I have been suffering from depression for the past 5 years. 

My symptoms include 

1) Feeling of no motivation
2) Difficulty in concentration
3) Anger issues (biting my fingers to a point, it bleeds, Throwing things, breaking my mobile, screaming, self harm etc) 
4) Tobacco addiction, couldn't stop (Whenever I try to quit something happens and go back to smoke) 
5) masturbation whenever stressed. 
6) Difficulty in falling asleep

I have tried 2 psychatrists and 3 psychologists. Nothing seems to be working. I didn't go to the last psychologists since they were asking 25,000 rupees for 12 sessions which I found it to be expensive. 

I have tried to workout, by work is kinda hectic and I am unable to wake up early because I sleep late and this has become a cycle. I tried to bulk because of my skinny structure but it seems after trying to gain some muscle, I have got cholestrol and prediabetes. This really demotivated me to eat anything. Plus, whenever I am stressed at work I just don't eat at all. I completely skip my breakfast/lunch many days. 

Coming to work 

I am one of the worst performer. In my last company, I was removed from my project because of my bad performance. However I managed to secure a job in another company but I feel like I am repeating the same mistake again. I am a developer with literally no skills cheating my manager as well as myself. Whenever I become stressed because of work, I turn off all the notifications and don't respond till evening. It seems some people have already started pointing out. I am 2018 graduate with 2.5 years gap. 3 years of total experience but still fail to understand many things in programming. Whereas graduates from 2021,22 are performing way better than me both in my current as well as previous organization. Because of my demotivation, I am putting way less efforts and gets dejected when they perform better/do the given tasks. 

Tablets tried : 

Lithium, Nexito 5, Olazapine, Newcita plus etc 

I don't know where to proceed, tried posting in many subs but it gets removed. Now my suicidal thoughts have become so high. 

Hobbies : I don't have any. My parents never encouraged to take up sports or dance/singing. I grew up as an introvert. I just don't know what to do. I feel like I am just bad at everything. Zero in academics because too many arrears, zero in work because of myself, zero in extra curricular activities partly because of myself.

Just to give a quick background, I am an M21 who is in the entertainment industry (this will be relevant later) and for about the past month or so I have been waking up and almost instantly feeling this sense of disturbance or anger coming from what feels like outta nowhere

And as I‚Äôll progress throughout my typical day, this anger or frustration will continue to show itself more. I‚Äôll be frustrated about having to talk to intolerant friends and family members. I‚Äôll be frustrated about feeling like people disagree with me all the time on just about everything. I‚Äôll be frustrated about people never understanding what I‚Äôm talking about and having to constantly explain what I said no matter what it is. I‚Äôll be frustrated having to interact with obnoxious fans on an almost daily basis as a manager. I‚Äôll be frustrated about not having anyone to confide in or have some form of intellectually stimulating conversation with. And I‚Äôll be frustrated about having to do ‚Äúnormal‚Äù sociable things when I don‚Äôt find them enjoyable or important.

I‚Äôve been managing to contain and suppress these frustrations but just as recently as yesterday I‚Äôve been having out-of-character outbursts/conflicts with others due to my own thoughts, feelings, and opinions on important or unimportant matters.

And now I‚Äôm at the point where I don‚Äôt even wanna discuss any of my ideas with anyone because I feel as though it‚Äôs a trivial pursuit if I‚Äôm just going to constantly be disagreed with and shut down. I don‚Äôt need validation or confirmation on my opinions, so there‚Äôs no point in even bringing them up. I‚Äôm more at peace with what I know personally vs what others think of me. The main issue is that I feel like I HAVE to engage in these types of conversations just to maintain my social rapport and keep my relationship with business partners afloat

I can understand that talking about how ‚Äúnobody understands me‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚Äúeverybody disagrees with my opinions‚Ä¶.‚Äù can come off as corny or even pretentious, I am aware of that and can understand if anybody feels that way from reading this. But the bottom line is that I just wanna understand what my current issue is.

Some I just left as drafts and never posted. Because I know that, overall, it changes **nothing**. ""Maybe if I write down my thoughts it will become a little bit easier?"" I vent, I cry, I scream, I hate myself, I ask questions and receive no answers. Because there are **no** answers. Anything I do, overall, DOES NOT MATTER. I've been struggling with clinical depression for more than 10 years. I think it's actually 15, but I am not sure. My ""friends"" mock me and say it's not a real thing. My parents mock me and say I just lazy and everything will become better once I get married. Gee, bro, not sure if I am really viewed as a potential husband for the past 7 or so years! Doctors don't do shit except ask for more and more money like I am a fucking ATM machine that prints money.

Ka-ching. Here, another 1000 $, take it.

Trust me, I tried. And tried, and tried and tried and tried

My life WON'T improve. 

And you kno... I can live with depression. I am a big boy, I can struggle, a lot of people struggle. A lot of people have no food or live on the streets or overall they live in worst conditions than me, so I should be grateful. What annoys the hell out of me is everything else beyond that depression. EVERYTHING in my life is a fucking mess and I have zero control over it. I live in a god-awful shithole of a country with no money and no means to escape. My health is trash and my attempts to fix it are laughable. The only person who actually tried to help me- I pushed them away, because I don't want them to suffer alongside. I don't think I was wrong but I miss having care and support. My cats are sick and I am so, so tired of being stressed, scared and feeling helpless. I wanted to become an artist, but, hah, of course NO ONE CARES. Sure, I don't draw for ""likes"" and ""views"", I love drawing for the sake of it, loved it since I was a little kid, but if no one sees it? No one interacts with it? What's the point? I can just draw it and never show to anyone. Here goes my dream of earning a living by doing what I love, lmao, guess I'll try in the next life! No, seriously, I know I am not some hot 100k followers artist but I never earned a single dollar with my art.

Every day it's something new. Every fucking day. I wake up and wonder ""hm what's that gonna be?"". You never know!

One day I got attacked in the shop, just minding my own bussiness. Another day I got attacked when I was throwing away garbage. I can never relax, I can barely sleep, my neighbours annoy the hell out of me with their noise. And somehow every time everyone around me twist like I AM the bad guy. ""You can't fight back!"" ""You can't criticize others!!"" ""Just shut up and struggle"". And sometimes I think, what even the point of my attempts? Every time I try to fix something or improve quality of my life, I fail miserably. I feel like ""Truman Show"" character, and audience watches me struggle and laughs at me while eating Cheetos. Hope you are having a great time, don't think this show gets renewed.

Sometimes I think how much better my life would have been if I was born in a different country. Maybe I would have met different people. Good people who were kind to me and didn't make me hate humanity as a whole. What if my parents weren't absolute sociopaths that ruined mental health. Huh.

1bl4vps,sometimes i feel like i'm only trying to get better so other people won't take pity on me,"it fucking sucks when someone says ""i wish you didn't feel that way"" or ""i hope you get better someday"" because i just crave external validation so badly. i feel like all my fucking mental health shit just acts a barrier to having a closer relationship (platonic or romantic) with someone, and i've lost so many relationships because they get tired of thinking i'm beyond help or that i need to get my fucking shit together before i can be in their life.

at least i can say ""i'm working on that in therapy"" or ""i'm taking medications for all of that"" so then they'll think i might be on some kind of upward trajectory, but i ultimately feel like i'm not doing any of this shit for myself. sure, it'd be nice to not want to die or to not rot in bed, but i don't want life in the first place. i hate that the only times i feel somewhat okay are when people are in my life and giving me attention, but i don't want that fucking negative attention. i don't want people talking down to me, trying to give me advice, or giving me pity instead of getting closer.

i'm terrified of being alone and isolated, but i don't know if i can ever get closer to people especially because i have so much fear and hopelessness around it, and then of course there's this whole issue of pity and detachment by other people.

i feel so fucking selfish because i should be happy that there are even people who are willing to talk to me, but it feels so conditional and temporary once i open up to them about how i actually feel.",drumass,2,0,1711128512,depression
1bl4ulw,I am tired of this cycle.,"I am (18M) youngest of three (24F) (26F), we all came from a pretty abusive household with a psychopath for a mother and a super strict protective father, we managed to all move out and go to another country, we all had very obvious unhealed traumas from our parents (i was the only person in the house who cleans, works and cooks whilst also studying and using my own freetime for hobbies and friends), and instead of ever receiving any sort of appreciation or even just a small thanks, id get belittled or ridiculed or yelled at for when i did not have enough energy to clean or cook, but i was completely numb to it as thats how they have been my whole life.

&#x200B;

Since now we're in a new country, I decided its time for a new chapter and start in my life, i decided to go to therapy to deal with my own traumas/problems as well as working out 6 times a week, few months later things are starting to look up, starting to make a lot of friends and having fun, eventually my friend introduces me to this (19F) girl, whom i hit it off with instantly, we talked alot and everything felt great, she invites me to her post exam party (party ended at 7 pm) and i ended up staying with her alone until 1 am, eventually we kept getting closer and closer, and opening up more and more, we both provided an immense amount of comfort and understanding for one another, we fell in love after 3 months of knowing each other, i would spend all my time with her to escape the shenanigans at home, after a few weeks of us together i decide to buy her a gift to show my gratitude for her love and affection, a bunch of items for around 80$, she hugs me and later on starts crying and tells me she loves me so much but she feels like she hasn't healed from her last relationship (4 months prior to meeting me with a very fucking horrible avoidant guy) and that i deserve better and she wants to be at her 100% with me, i tell her that healing isn't a linear process and that she doesn't have to go through this alone and she continues to disagree, breaks up with me, ""remain as friends"".

Suddenly she acts distanced and passive aggressive for 2 whole months, one day i couldn't excuse being disrespected for the compromise of love anymore and i asked her to see me so we can talk about it and we did, she ends up telling me that she doesn't see me as anything but a friend and she can't let me get any closer to her than ""this"" because i will hurt myself, i lose my shit because i was lead on and hurt, cut off all contact (01/29/2024). 

&#x200B;

Now back home, everything feels 15x worse, the complete and utter silence of my phone is haunting, i don't have any friends because all of my friends were in her friend group, don't have university until august,  don't talk to anyone at gym because i hate being bothered in the gym myself, sex drive and lovesickness at an all time high, can't tone out and be numb to the bullshit of my siblings because she pulled me out of that world and truly showed me what it meant like to be loved, nothing i can do about it, everyday feels harder than the last to wake up, go out once a week to buy groceries because we live in a small town and i end up seeing her almost everytime i go out with the rest of my friends. its genuinely so fucking dreadful, i'm willing to take any advice on what can i do. 

TL;DR Horrid family, love of my life pulls me out of that world, makes me truly experience life and its pleasures, breaks up with me, can't move on or do anything, even the idea of going to therapy to move on, reminds me of her so thats counterproductive. wrote 3 different itterations of suicide notes last week, every single day gets fucking harder, any help is great.",Brilliant_Lock4481,1,0,1711128433,depression

1bl3c83,I've given up on me,"I guess this is just me venting, as any friends or family would see this and start worrying like crazy.  I (42M) have had depression and anxiety my entire life.  As a kid, we didn't know what it was (especially in the black community).  I was just seen as ""something is wrong with me"".  I've always been introverted and sensitive.  With that, I have never had a positive view of myself, and low self-esteem was/is normal for me.  

Fast forward to today.  Divorced, 3 kids (13M, 10M, 3F), and just depressed as hell.  My 3yo was a happy surprise, and she keeps me on my toes.  She and her mom live with me, but the relationship with her mom is pretty much just roommates and co-parenting.  

On the outside, it looks like I don't have a reason to complain.  When I look at it, I really don't have a reason to complain, but my brain chemistry just won't allow me to be happy.  I've been on meds for years, did TMS Therapy, and that worked to help me not have the doom feeling all the time.  That also reduced my suicide ideation a ton.  What they, or therapy, haven't fix is that I don't care about myself, and I don't even know how.

There's been a series of events, especially in the last 6 months, that when all added together just broke me.  Most of it happening around me, and to the people I love.  It has me to the point where I don't have the capacity to pursue any romantic relationship ever again.  Once my daughter gets out of daycare, her mom will be able to afford to live on her own, then we can share custody.  I will miss not having my daughter with me everyday, but her mother deserves WAY better than what I'm not giving her.  I can't love her the way she deserves to be love, or anyone else ever again for that matter.  I just want to be single for the rest of my life.  I could care less about intimacy because I can take care of myself without the need to have performance anxiety, sweat because I'm fat, blah blah blah.

I don't know how to ""love me"" and don't think I want to.  I just want to keep myself alive and employed to take care of my kids.  I don't want to traumatize them by taking my life, that part scares the shit out of me and I love them too much.  I can play the long game of appearing like I'm okay for them, my job, family and friends.  I have to do that because I refuse, REFUSE to burden anyone with my feelings about me.  I've faked it for 42 years, and just have to fake it until my daughter is an adult, and then I can really be done.

1bl2y81,It's becoming overwhelming,"I'm normally not one to talk about my feelings, largely due to not even having anyone to talk to, or the funds to talk to a professional.

I'm 36, divorced with two kids, 13 and 11...also recently out of an engagement(although we are still good friends).

I feel like there's so much weighing on me, that I don't know where to start.

After splitting with my ex-fianc√©e and now living alone with absurd rent and all other usual bills, I am struggling to make ends meet. My ex-wife has moved my kids 3 hours away, and with child support being one of my usual expenses, I can barely afford to visit them. She has recently talked about wanting to move them from PA to Illinois for the sake of her family, to which I said absolutely not. Well, it seems that I am the bad guy now, since all of the sudden my kids have this urge to want to move there. They've never mentioned it once before, and now they won't even talk to me...no returning my calls or replying to my texts.

I live alone, and everyday after work I find myself being a hermit, since I can't afford to go out. I don't have a single friend who I can call to grab a drink with, so I often drink alone at home. I do not drink during the week, and always have a glimmer of hope of doing something fun on the weekend...to no avail. Everyday now when I get home from work, I sit in silence and wonder why...why the fuck is this all happening. I lost my kids in a sense, I lost my fianc√©e, I went from doing real estate with her full-time(she owns the real estate office we are with), to thankfully securing a full-time job with decent pay and good hours.  With the loss of her and I's relationship, came the lost of all the friends we would hang out with. Her friends had their boyfriends/husbands that I would hangout with, and I haven't heard a word from anyone since the split.

My physical health isn't 100% which takes a toll on me. I have arthritis in both knees, which makes doing a lot of what I love, very hard to do. I am receiving disability from the VA for this, since it first started up as an issue when I was active duty. Running, hiking, lifting weights, calisthenics...all things I would love to do, I almost can't. I am 6'2"" and about 280lbs, and I would love to get down to about 230, but with a thyroid issue and limited capabilities due to my knees, it seems I can only maintain a healthy diet and do mostly upper body, which can only do so much.

As I'm typing this, it doesn't seem to be the biggest issues, but I feel defeated and so alone in life, and ponder daily if it's worth it. My kids are the only reason I am here, but as of late, I begin to even wonder how affected they would be if I wasn't here.

I'm crossing my fingers that things can improve, and I am doing my best to put effort into making things improve...but that all still doesn't help me not feel alone.

I realize this may have gone off course, and I am not the best at explaining how I am feeling, but I did feel the need to at least get it off my chest.",realtor_snipe,1,0,1711123773,depression

I am medicated for depression and anxiety. I go on walks. I go to gym. I play videogames. I draw. I eat healthy. I eat tasty. I have a healthy sleep schedule. I go out. None of that works anymore. I feel sick and I feel tired. I feel scared and alone. I don't know what to do and it's hard to want to do anything anymore.

Every day, every hour, CONSTANTLY, I wish for death. I don't want to do it to myself, I just want it to happen to me. A freak accident. An unavoidable event. Some incurable disease. I am so tired of feeling like this.

I desperately want to cry. I want to show my emotions. I used to be so in touch with my emotions - I could speak about things, I could cry about things... Now, nothing. I try to cry, nothing. A few tears at best. Not enough to call it ""crying"", just enough to call ""teary-eyed"". 

It's taking a toll on my relationship with my girlfriend. I'm disappointing her more and more each day - forgetting important details, constantly going quiet and keeping to myself, snapping over small things I used to be able to talk calmly about... I don't feel good for her anymore. Our one year anniversary came and went. I didn't forget about it, but I definitely didn't make her feel special. And it hurt her. I am so afraid of hurting her more and wasting her time. But she has been so patient with me. I want to go back to being the man she fell in love with.

It doesn't feel like I'm making any progress, it doesn't feel like ""two steps forward, one step back"", it feels like I'm constantly stuck at square one.

1bl1n5n,I feel like there‚Äôs more and I‚Äôm alone ,"I‚Äôm not sure how to start this. I think I was drawn to this place because of the comfortable anonymity. So I think I can say it. I‚Äôm a writer- I write poems and I have written stories in the past. I‚Äôve been inclined to it above everything else and I still feel like it‚Äôs my most primitive and natural instinct to write. I keep diaries. I write everything in them. So naturally, if anyone read them‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm incessantly looking for something more. I have glimmers of fleeting moments etched into my mind and I have cultivated poems from them. I feel like I belong in these moments. I feel at home when I listen to songs and lyrics that evoke this emotion. I feel like I‚Äôm meant to live. Live like no one has ever live. I have this persistent and compelling desire to find out what this all means. To live all these moments and discover the unknown. To be bathed in thrill and to feel voraciously. I know this is all verbose and complicated- but I couldn‚Äôt possibly express the desperation and urgency I feel without‚Ä¶this. And I‚Äôm alone. I don‚Äôt expect others to absorb what I say and just blurt out sweet nothings. I don‚Äôt expect to be understood. I wish I was acknowledged and admired and listened to. But there‚Äôs no such person. I have so much hope that I‚Äôm yet to know all the people I will love- inspired by a post I saw on Pinterest ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt met all the people you will love‚Äù. There‚Äôs something so enigmatic about it- yet so, so relieving. 

But these are thoughts. When it boils down to what is real- I‚Äôm barely in it. My parents expect things from me. Society has drawn out rigid paths for compliance. I have a disdain for people who think that a person is simply a perception of them. And I feel that we are reduced to our perceptions all the time. You might be thinking that I posted under the wrong thread, this all makes more sense philosophically. But the truth is that I‚Äôm in so much pain- and it‚Äôs because of all this that I‚Äôm suffering. I feel tormented when no one did anything in particular to hurt me. I feel pressured to conform and be reduced to my ‚Äúideal‚Äù and ‚Äúrational‚Äù self. I‚Äôm 16. I don‚Äôt know anything about college or the world. I feel that I‚Äôm being pigeon-holed into a path that promises success- but at what cost? Writing an essay to a university, how much of myself can I release? I certainly cannot attach my Reddit profile because then they would read this and find out who I actually am. So I‚Äôm living a superficial lie. And then I realise that we‚Äôre all living a superficial lie. I‚Äôve had countless revelations like these over a period of time and I believe they have all collated to create my depression. There‚Äôs so much left unspoken. I haven‚Äôt even begun to express how shattered I feel every single day. How desperate and devoid I am of love. But if no one knows, at least you do now. I‚Äôll surely write more, and i‚Äôll certainly vent here.

1bl05u4,"I'm safe now, so it's like the dam holding the emotions back has burst...","This post may be upsetting because it discusses the topic of suicide attempts in the past. It's not graphic, I assure you.

--/

Seven months ago, I tried to kill myself.

In the immediate aftermath, I was relieved to be alive, but soon regressed back to suicidality.

I then decided that I would fight to live on for the sake of those who cared for me, but with no intrinsic desire to remain alive.

Now, finally, after all this time, I can say that I want to stay for this show -- for my own self.

And suddenly, there's a whole bunch of things happening. I'm getting intrusive images which are both memories and visions of my death. I instinctively wince at these before I realise what has happened. My heartbeat goes supersonic and my face becomes as hot as a summer day. I even lose my balance sometimes.

Emotionally, there's multiple issues:

1. There was a significant duration in which I thought that I was going to die and that no amount of medical help could change that. Just experiencing that has changed me.

2. Physiologically speaking, I don't know how I am alive. I'm not being dramatic here. I didn't gently approach the line between life and death and then back off. I ran full speed towards that line, too fast to stop. And yet, here I am.

3. When I think of what would have happened after I had died, if I had died, my eyes must up. I feel guilty, utterly guilty, when I think of what mum, dad, sis, and friends would have had to go through if I had died. Including the discovery of the body, the last rites... And their grief. Their self blame. My throat's going all chokey as I type this.

4. I'm terrified that my demons will return to finish what they started. There's nothing too substantial keeping the lid on them.

So, yeah. All this is swirling in my heart.

I know I need a trauma therapist, but apart from that.... What do I do? How do I forgive myself? How do I stop seeing myself as being a bad person for what I've done?",StayingUp4AFeeling,1,2,1711116621,depression

1bkzgen,Broken Self,"What do you do when no one answers when you call? I (46F) have never really had a home or friends. No one to really care about me. As a baby, I was born slightly deformed. I didn't know I was until I was about 8yrs I guess. Maybe 13yrs, that was the age my mother told me and I have never looked in the mirror the same way since. By the time I was 9 months old, (I have a photo of me at that age) you can't tell that my face was crooked. I can though. I almost died twice as a baby. My father was cleaning his guns and my mother had laid me on the floor next to him. The gun fired missing me by about a foot from what my mother told me. The first time it was a break-over shotgun so I don't understand how he couldn't have known it was loaded. I think they were both drunk. I almost died as a toddler. My mother left me on the shore of a lake, I was about 3yrs, and she swam away from me. I had tried to reach her and almost drowned because no one was watching me. At about 7yrs, my father almost drowned me. He had grabbed my ankles and dragged me underwater about three feet into deep water. My aunt and uncle that was there was laughing at me as I crawled out of the water coughing up water. I remember my father telling me I was fine and to just get up and go back to swimming. I never went back in the water while with any of them around. If I did, the water had to be clear and I always needed to know where they were to me. A few times they tried to get my cousins to drag me in the water. They all stopped when I held one of them under the water and blooded the nose of another. At age 7yrs my mother and father were divorced. My mother had abandoned us to our father. She always had an excuse as to why we couldn't visit. The courts had given her my younger brothers (conceived during a separation while drinking) and me and the oldest boy to our father. But she just left all of us with him. In many ways, he was the better parent. We were always broke and mostly homeless. I say mostly homeless because we would live with my grandparents and aunt and uncle (my dad's sister) Later I learned that when we weren't living with them, it was because my father was fighting with my aunt and uncle. usually over money.At around 10yrs, we were back with my mom. Living with her sister and son. Then we were at my grandmother's (her mom) until they would be fighting over money. At 11yrs we finally had a home but our mother was once again tired of being a parent. She was able to send my brothers to live with our father again, but I refused to go and my step-mother told my father that she didn't want me with them. For years it went like this. my mother trying to trick me into living with my father and my stepmother fighting to keep me out. Whenever I was forced to live with them, she would move out. I was made to know that her leaving was my fault. At 13 or 14yrs, I had enough of that. Three knock down drag out fights finished that living situation. Back at my mother's but I was never home. I would go to school just to eat. I would go to friends' homes just to feel wanted but learned I wasn't by their parents. It would go on like that until I was 18yrs.That's when I would just be dating someone just to learn he didn't want me either. At 21, I married a man who told me he only married me because I looked like his true love (mother of his twins conceived after we married) At 18yrs, I had planned to end myself at 21, but I was pregnant. I had hoped my marriage would get better because we were having a son. Instead, he kicked us out when my son was 2 months and moved her in. We were homeless and so that I could work, I had to force my mother to watch her grandson. She only would if the weird neighbor wouldn't. My ex-husband refused to pay support and I couldn't get paid enough so I couldn't afford childcare. I was able to keep us in a home but barely kept the lights on. I spend years alone with my son. Every ""man"" I was interested in was not interested in me beyond a one-night stand. When my son was 7yrs, I met someone. I was so lonely, I didn't care about his past. But his past caused me to spiral. Lost our home. Lost my friends. So after finally giving him up, I moved us to my mother's to start over. Then I lost my son. He went into CPS and I was forced to spend so much time fighting for him with no help. No support. Having to beg ""family"" to at the very least take him in. I am alone living in the Salvation Army shelter. I met someone. He was alone too. I tried again. Had a daughter, while still fighting for my son. CPS kept telling him I was on drugs and didn't want to visit him. CPS would tell me that he didn't want to see me. Once I called the state capital CPS home of and forced a review of my case, my son was returned to me. But the child I got back wasn't my son. I got a young man that thought it was ok to steal from me. The TPS refused to educate him, so I had to send him to my brother's so he could go to school. Instead, he quit and started doing drugs. For 8 years, I have supported him, supported his then-girlfriend. Helped them get jobs and gave them a home. All that was asked of them was to watch his sister and clean up after themselves. My home turned into a dumpster and I had to force them out. She committed su\*\*ide  and my son was there when it happened. So I was back to supporting him. He would put me down. Make sure I knew I was worthless as a mother and blame me for HIS depression. Here it is 2024, my daughter will soon be 8yrs and my son is 24 and I am so depressed, so tired, so alone that I no longer want to wake up in the morning. I don't want my daughter to be the one that finds me. I don't want to leave her behind to a world she will never know love in. So I sit here crying. I woke up again and now I got to try and find some strength to care for her. I want to scream. I want to through things. I want my sadness to just die. just a few days ago I had asked the Goddess to bring into my life someone to help me. To be my support. Now, I am facing homelessness again. I am facing being unemployed again. I am facing my daughter going to CPS again. I have learned this lesson. I don't want to repeat this lesson again. I have failed at life. Not the lessons learned. I don't know what to do. I just don't wish to wake up in the morning again. I can't off myself because I don't want it to be my daughter to find me.

1bkxak1,I am full of shame,"I have major depression and am a very anxious person. I think I lot of my feelings of emptiness and fear which I struggle with stem from a deep sense of shame which I cant seem to get rid of. Ive come really far in the past year or so, i was a complete recluse from a young age and suffered from terrible social anxiety. Now i have friends, a loving partner, im pursuing a difficult degree which I am passionate about, and i am very fit and enjoy my hobby of long distance running. However its never enough. If i could ve seen the life I would have 2 years ago when I was all alone and hopeless I would have been overwhelmed. But instead of being filled with gratitude and pride everyday i wake up feeling empty and worthless, and the future still seems just as terrifying and hopeless as ever. 

I just cant love myself, i still see myself as the outsider and deep down I dont think I belong. i am always comparing myself with others and worrying about the future. I worry I dont have enough friends, I feel jealous of people who go out every week and always seem to have someone to hang out with.  I constantly feel like i dont have enough friends and my relationships arent deep enough. Not to mention im terrified to rely on anyone and often find it hard to see why anyone would want to be my friend in the first place.
I dont think i study enough, im not smart enough, im not fast enough, etc. its NEVER enough for me. 

I really dont like myself. I still see that sad, lonely, ugly little girl who sat in the corner and sometimes cried silently in class. The weird kid with no friends. I think i was one of the only ones at my school who didn‚Äôt have a single friend. How could there NOT be something wrong with me? Im convinced that my life will be forever cursed by loneliness and not belonging, and everything ive worked for will just fall apart anyway. 
I just want to get with of this dark cloud of shame that hangs over my head everyday. ",Leading-Mouse1228,1,1,1711107957,depression

It feels like there is no point in waking up or even living because life feels so pointless. Most of the time I hate waking up, I just wish to sleep forever. 

Thing is though, people (my parents especially), just say I'm lazy, irresponsible, and that I don't have self-control. I try to tell myself that my pain is real, but now I question if it even is. Am I really just a lazy person who wants attention or just wants it easy in life by saying I have this mental illness? Or is this real and not some sad excuse. I haven't been diagnosed of anything because my parents don't really know or particularly care about bringing me to a psychiatrist, they even use it as a threat whenever I feel very depressed. They mock this generation for ""having depression and committing suicide"". They are religious which doesn't help things. I'm too scared to tell them anything. 

Help me understand if I'm just some sad attention seeker wanting an easier life or if this is actually real.

1bkvyju,"I'm sorry it is a long post, but I have to let it all out","I have been in therapy and medications for 6 years now. It all started when I left a confusingly toxic home to become a writer. Before that I lived my whole life trying to get approval from my parents. Everything I did was just to make them happy, until I finally gave in and could gather enough courage leave home and still living, trying to get them to say that they are proud of me.

I left home to become a writer, thought of getting a job on the side to pay my bills as I didn't have any support from family. After years of trying, I do get appreciation wherever I go, but earning hardly anything from it. And the job which was supposed to be a backup for my writing career, has become the main thing and writing is not even backup now.

In 26 years of my life, I have got abused physically by parents, raped on multiple occasions by a cousin, an uncle, got sexually abused by strangers on 2 different occasions. I started dating at the age of 15, coz I had to look for love outside, as I wasn't getting it at home. I gave love a chance, 5 times in my whole life. In first 2, I got cheated on, third one left coz her best friends thought I wasn't good for her, 4th one was all good at first but then things started getting very toxic. The person I was with, would lie and cheat, would call me randomly and say some cuss words and hang up, with me trying to figure out what just happened. Things went on to get so bad that just to get out of it, for the first time in my life, while being in a relationship, when someone who is not my girlfriend, tried to kiss me, I didn't stop her. When I realised what I just did, I couldn't live that. I would get the episodes of anxiety where I couldn't even breathe and would be rolling on the floor. I couldn't live with the disgust of what I had become.

I tried to kill myself on multiple occasions. I didn't want to just hurt myself, I wanted this life to end. But don't know what it is with me and death that no matter how much accurately I would plan it, I won't die, somehow. I don't see any hope, any point of living this life anymore.

With the frustration in my last job, I even had to quit it.

Now with hardly any money on me, any work on me, any family or friends or anyone by myside, I am sitting here in my apartment, with a half burnt cigarette, teared up eyes, almost choking, trying to figure out how to get another work and pay my rent next month, and for my therapy and for my medications.

Funny thing is, the last piece of work I have written so far, was my suicide note.

I don't know what to do from here.

1bkvygk,Life has been overwhelming me. I‚Äôve been having thoughts lately that scare me. ,"I‚Äôve never been diagnosed, but I think I‚Äôve been living with depression on and off for a long time now. This time though it‚Äôs been harder to push the bad thoughts away. 

Im single and close to 40 and this last half year has been one of the roughest and I‚Äôm struggling to find a light to  guide me.

- July, car broke down. Out of commission for two plus months. 
- August, put myself into financial hardship to keep job since they wouldn‚Äôt let me work remote or hybrid and they are a 45 minute drive away. Had to get a second vehicle I couldn‚Äôt afford. 
- September, company reorganization. I get switched to a whole new job, team, and building. I know no one and I‚Äôm not a social person. I struggle with the new position. 
- October, my mom dies. This one hurts a ton because she was always there for me and now I don‚Äôt have anyone I trust to talk to. 
- November, get fired. Got told that I was missing deadlines and job functions that I was never informed about. 
- December, get a new job, it doesn‚Äôt pay the bills. Start to get behind on everything. Can‚Äôt afford a Christmas for me and my kids that I have split custody of. 
- January, mine and my moms birthday month. I start struggling with my age and how unaccomplished and worthless I feel. 
- February, have several promising interviews for better jobs. Got rejected from the one I thought I did the best at and have been ghosted on the others. Feeling pretty worthless. 
- March, one kid gets admitted to a behavioral health center with suicidal thoughts that I was unaware of. CPS starts an investigation into me on alleged abuse of a different kid which is completely bogus. Get served to go to a custody hearing next week. I have no information about what‚Äôs going on. I‚Äôm also several months behind on mortgage and other bills. Oh, and I got fired this week again because I can‚Äôt concentrate on work. 

I‚Äôve always kicked the bad thoughts away because I‚Äôve never wanted to leave my kids. But now I might be losing them and I‚Äôm spiraling. They are the last things that have been keeping me grounded to this life. 

I‚Äôve thought of whether I would give things away and to whom. I‚Äôve thought about what notes and mementos I would leave behind. I‚Äôve thought of how I would do it. I‚Äôm scared because anytime I‚Äôve had those thoughts, I‚Äôve dismissed them immediately. But now, there‚Äôs a maybe to them all. I pulled up the website on my phone to call the other day because the thoughts got intense on my drive home. 

I‚Äôm so tired. I‚Äôm tired of failing. I‚Äôm tired of being not good enough. The one thing I thought I had was being a good dad and that‚Äôs getting taken away. I‚Äôm tired of wasting everyone‚Äôs time and thoughts. ",gurton_g_buster,7,3,1711103010,depression
1bkvtsm,I never want to talk to my sister again,"I have a sister who I want to cut off but I need help in knowing if I should or not so here you go  
I have a sister who is 3-4 years younger than me. We used to be relatively close when we were younger. However, as time went by, I was a lot more focused on school and friends so we talked a lot less. When quarantine happened, I isolated myself and was just watching shows and studying on my own so I hardly even saw her or spoke with her and wherever we did it was always an argument. It's been 4 years now since we had an honest heart-to-heart. And in these 4 years, she has grown up to be someone I detested. She would swear at my mother and sometimes act physically with her, she would also swear at my stepdad when all they both did was concern themselves with her well-being, appearance, education, and relationship with god . She would speak to my mother with such attitude and sarcasm which would make me dislike her even more. She steals their money. She even ran away from home once, and my mother and uncle had to chase after her. My stepdad has an issue with his feet and is due to have surgery later this year, and my mother has extremely varicose veins. so you can imagine how distraught I was to find her laughing about their failed attempt at chasing after her. It reached a point where I thought I was at fault since I am the older sister, and maybe she was acting out because I don't talk to her anymore. So I said sorry for the way I've treated her. She said sorry too and we both cried. A day later, I talked to her about her actions and how disrespectful it is, but nothing changed. Funnily enough, she swears at my mother at some point in the day, every day, and still acts the same way with attitude religion, etc, even with me now she steals my clothes, not returning them, my makeup, my food, and lies about it and is also rude to me as well and shows no emotion when I speak to her kindly as though I am speaking to the dead. I want to cut her off completely now but want to make sure I'm justified in doing that. I want to also say my mom works hard 4 jobs every day my uncle doesnt work due to his leg and so it hurts to see my mom lose her money because of a thieving daughter.",LetHour9996,9,11,1711102499,depression

Told my family I need help. That getting up, making food and drinking water is getting to be impossible some days. That I feel so empty, unmotivated and alone every day. Rent and food princes keep going up, and the realization I‚Äôll never have a home or family of my own is affecting me. I want a future but don‚Äôt see one. That just talking with them helps. That I need guidance and advice, I can‚Äôt do this alone. That my therapist told me to talk to my family, because going back to a psych ward would make everything so much worse. I crave connection so bad I dream about it. That I do want help and to get better, but with every step in the right direction I make, I keep getting pushed back 3. I still want to keep trying, but am overwhelmed with memories, debt, and unending news about the world getting more impossible to live in. Climate change and pandemics currently affecting the reality I‚Äôm in, but I‚Äôm told talking about it will be weird, and break normalcy. 

Them: Wow, that‚Äôs a lot. You‚Äôre kind of bumming me out, and I don‚Äôt want to sit with an uncomfortable feeling long enough to even pretend faking empathy. That anything other than puppies and kittens, I don‚Äôt want to talk about. That my voice is going to remain cold and distracted through this conversation so you can tell I think you‚Äôre crazy. There‚Äôs nothing the doctors will find through the tests to explain your symptoms. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with your heart, you‚Äôre just overthinking. You don‚Äôt need a diagnosis, just need to try harder. You should talk to a therapist about this. Even though you can‚Äôt afford one anymore after your job laid you off. Which was all your fault by the way. Sucks for you I guess. Anyway have I told you about this party I went to- 

Told my family I got 3 letters from the hospital booking me for cardiology appointments. I still don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with my body. I feel like my past is catching up to me. I‚Äôve taken responsibility on my choices and actions, know where I messed up, and where I just needed more support. I‚Äôve struggled with procrastination and anxiety which affected my work and studies. I wasn‚Äôt able to finish post-secondary school, and got fired. I‚Äôm trying to change, and want to make better choices. But the days keep slipping by faster than I can keep up. I want to grow and be gentler, but keep getting panic attacks that seems to leech hours from the day. I keep falling asleep randomly and stay asleep for too long. That even when I‚Äôm awake, everything feels so dark and heavy. Like I‚Äôm constantly pulling 10,000 pounds on my back and can‚Äôt drop it. That even though I‚Äôm sober, I feel like I‚Äôm walking in a dream, everything‚Äôs fuzzy and snapping out of it takes up all the little energy I do have. I keep getting angry at myself for not having enough energy, too much anxiety. How it feels like my mind is torturing my body. How every therapy technique I‚Äôve been given doesn‚Äôt stop it. I‚Äôve been to over 3 dozen councillors, therapists and psychologists, majority telling me I‚Äôm beyond what they are capable of treating. I‚Äôve listened to countless podcasts and books about tips and tricks, grounding techniques and naming every emotion I feel. Nothing helps. That my mind consumes me with extreme guilt and rage over small accidents like dropping a glass. I keep screaming at myself alone in my apartment because I‚Äôm so frustrated I can‚Äôt bring myself to get up. That I know I‚Äôm self-destructing, but don‚Äôt know how to stop spiralling. That I don‚Äôt want to burden them with my mind, but if they would talk to me like a human, maybe I‚Äôll start feeling like one. If they could just call me every once in a while, let me know I‚Äôm not as alone as I know I am. That maybe if they see physical reasons I‚Äôm suffering, instead of mental, they‚Äôll possibly take me seriously. If they saw a broken heart instead of a broken mind, they might care. To listen to what I‚Äôm saying instead of making assumptions or opinions. I‚Äôm not blaming them or even myself anymore for the past, I just want to get better and live. That I‚Äôm being honest, because that‚Äôs what they said I should do. But when I‚Äôm honest about being suicidal, they look at me like I‚Äôm a monster. Begging them to just tell me to keep trying. 

Them: This is your fault, and because of only your choices. Why are you telling me about your medical issues. You‚Äôre being ungrateful for the past help we‚Äôve given. There is something wrong with you, but it‚Äôs your soul and sins. I‚Äôm going forget the actions of the people from this family who gave you panic attacks by chasing you through the house screaming at you to be normal after you wore blue lipstick to school once. That we said we didn‚Äôt believe you. That we said being gay isn‚Äôt something this family agrees with. That you should forgive the beatings your father gave you. You should ignore him saying in front of your sister, that he doesn‚Äôt love you, and no one likes you. That your sister agreed. It was your fault CPS made him feel temporary shame, but then believed him when he said he never hurt you. Ignore the trauma your mothers violent death at her own hands gave you. That even though you remember at 10 years old telling her to stop being distracted driving, she kept doing it. Why can‚Äôt you get your drivers license. Why can‚Äôt you get a job. Why can‚Äôt you just eat. Why can‚Äôt you just be normal and just stop thinking. You‚Äôre obviously not trying hard enough. Now, if you‚Äôre done complaining, I‚Äôm not going to talk to you for the next 6 months, and ‚Äúpray‚Äù you‚Äôll find the light.

1bku13l,How depression and anxiety made me implode both mentally and physically ,"I‚Äôve been struggling with moderate depression and anxiety throughout my entire life and pretty much learned how to live with it. Ironically living with these conditions wasn‚Äôt  the part I became the most skilled at. Hiding how I was actually feeling every day was my super power.

 Let‚Äôs face it no one wants to be around a person that is constantly in a bad headspace and doesn‚Äôt want to leave the house due to overwhelming anxiety. The result was as you‚Äôd expect I was the kid that always had a smile on his face and pretended like  I wasn‚Äôt suffering of crippling anxiety and depression just so I could fit in. 

This strategy worked pretty good and even though I was suffering every day I managed to sustain a ‚Äúnormal life‚Äù.  At some point you no longer feel like you‚Äôre suffering because you‚Äôre kind of normalizing the emotional and physical pain accompanied by these mental health conditions. But obviously I reached my limit at some point. I quite literally imploded both mentally and physically. 

It started with slightly heightened anxiety which then got worse and worse until I was so anxious I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed because I would literally pass out.  My resting heart rate would average around 120 bpm, and I experienced shortness of breath all day. Couldn‚Äôt eat, couldn‚Äôt sleep, couldn‚Äôt concentrate. 

Then I also unlocked a new range of symptoms. Derealisation and  depersonalisation scared the living shit out of me. It got so bad that at some point it felt like I woke up in a complete nightmare. About 90% of my memories were gone and I had this weird out of body feeling 24/7. 

I‚Äôve been struggling with suicidal ideation before but due to the exacerbated anxiety and depression this time the emotional and physical pain became so unbearable that I started planning to end my life. 

Luckily my attempt was pretty half assed mainly because I didn‚Äôt had the mental energy to think it through properly. 

I got admitted to a psychiatric hospital and I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder. The psychiatrist put me on both sertraline (SSRI) and bupropion (SNDRI) and I started seeing a therapist. 

Moral of the story: don‚Äôt think you can overcome these cruel mental health conditions by yourself. I kept al my problems to myself because I was ashamed of them. 

I literally had so many reasons not to feel the way I felt. I have a loving family that support me in any way possible, have lovely friends that make me feel comfortable with being myself, never ever struggled financially, although I wouldn‚Äôt describe myself as good looking I have been told that I have decent looks, and psychological  tests revealed that my IQ scores around 125. I bet some people would pay a lot of money to posses al these things but I felt insanely numb about them which caused a ton of guilt and low self esteem 

Later on my psychiatrist explained that depression often isn‚Äôt caused by your life conditions but rather influenced by your perspective on these conditions. 

Having depression or anxiety is NOT your fault.  Yes some lucky people in this world may barely or never struggle with them whilst you can‚Äôt live a normal life. 

Life is not fair. I know that sounds extremely pessimistic but once you start accepting  it you find yourself comparing your life to other people‚Äôs lives less often. 

For those of you reading this who are also thinking about ending their lives. Please hear me out. 

I won‚Äôt give you some glamourised speech about why life is worth living. Because if you‚Äôre actively thinking about suicide you‚Äôre going through pain so extreme that I‚Äôll probably never ever find the words to comprehend your suffering. 

That said only the fact that you‚Äôre reading these words and are still breathing proves incomprehensible courage and mental strength. 

Even though suicide crossed your mind numerous times you‚Äôre still here. I can imagine you might not believe this but the fact you‚Äôre still here is because there is still something in you that wants to live. 

Every time suicide crosses your mind and you dismiss the thought is proof that deep inside you there is something that wants to live and more importantly believes there is still hope. 

Sending lots of love and hugs to all of you suffering ‚ù§Ô∏è

1bktzus,I hope I get it all right before I turn 30,"Description of me-self for context:   
Above average IQ and high conscientiousness (flips easily into anxiety)  
Middle-class Filipino male raised from childhood in a fundamentalist Christian community believing in Rapture theology (fucked up repressed teenage years and childhood)  
2nd of 8 siblings  
No experience in heterosexual relationships and sexual intercourse  


It's so hard to gather myself and dedicate to any kind of long-term tasks and work.  
I'm turning 27 in 5 days on the 27th. It should feel like a turning point now but I've been in a depressive rut for 7+ years having accomplished nothing with my life. I never finished college because I found great difficulty in concentrating on long-term tasks and I always had a cruel inner voice which prevented me from working hard.  
I was diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder at a psych clinic in late 2017 after my first severe mental breakdown at home. Got prescribed with Brintellix and afterwards Quetiapine for more than a year and was completely meds-free by January 2019.  
Mostly drifted by at life for all the years since then...  
I still live with my parents in a remote rural area where public transport is infrequent and I don't have a driver's license to travel around. I don't have a job or the financial means to leave so I can be in a stimulating environment like art studios, dance clubs, or museums. Sometimes, I play the lottery just for the blind hope of getting money to fly away.  
I just spend my days on the internet consuming philosophy content or playing video games and watching porn. I wish this cycle could just end. I want to make more art and live out there as a real human bean (and a real hero). Fuck being poor if I have to.   
On the plus side, I've been taking psilocybin mushrooms by micro dosing and occasional heroic doses since mid 2022.  I'm in a good episode right now, I believe, because of the shrooms.   
I just don't know how to start anew and take more charge of my own life because I've been powerless and helpless for so long.

1bkttc9,Is it too late to have healthy teeth?,"Hi there,

I'm a 21-year-old woman, and I've been dealing with depression for most of my life. Because of this, I haven't been taking care of myself well, especially when it comes to my physical health, like dental care.

Growing up, I wasn't great at brushing my teeth and flossing regularly. Even though I knew it was important, I often skipped it, especially when I became more independent. It's not that I didn't know how to do it or wasn‚Äôt taught how; it's just that the feeling and sensation of brushing my teeth felt uncomfortable, so I avoided it when I could which became more and more frequent as i aged. 

When I got braces at 12, things got worse. Some parts of my teeth were covered, and I couldn't clean them properly even when i did feel up to brushing. I ended up with cavities under my braces, so they had to take them off way too early, and I lost track of my retainer, so my teeth shifted back after the braces were removed. I feel terrible because my parents spent a lot of money on my braces, and I didn't take care of my teeth properly. I have a stage 3 overbite which has always caused me extreme issues in my self esteem and having a habit where i put things in front of my mouth when i‚Äôm talking, without even noticing i‚Äôm doing so. I‚Äôd have to spend another 5 grand on braces to get rid of the overbite. 

Now, my teeth are yellow, I have several cavities, and two of my teeth are broken, falling apart into pieces. I'm scared to go to the dentist because I'm ashamed of letting it get this bad. I'm worried that even if I go and get the cavities fixed, my teeth will still look disgusting and I'll have spent hundreds on fillings to still have extreme self esteem issues. 

I feel like I've ruined my teeth in the first 20 years of my life, and I'm angry at myself for it. This is a big factor in my depression as ironic as it sounds. I don‚Äôt wanna go out and have fun because i‚Äôll laugh and smile and then it‚Äôs just all on display. 
I'm afraid I'll never have nice teeth without spending thousands on procedures like veneers or expensive whitening treatments, and I'll always have gaps in my teeth from breaks and them being shaven down due to cavities

1bktgjz,Self talk and perspectiv,"Hello, I‚Äôve been struggling with mental illness for a while now and I noticed that change in my outlook on it has affected my mental state drastically.

i used to say that frustration with myself ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt me‚Äú and I‚Äôd almost try to de associate it with myself, i thought of it like a demon in my head, but within the last year I started viewing it as just me having frustration and annoyances with myself, I also stopped letting the negativity engulf me, as I had a bad habit of becoming fully self critical when I got even a little frustrated, partly because it garnered me sympathy at a time I wasn‚Äôt capable of gaining it in other ways. I‚Äôm sorry for my ramblings but I really only started to notice these changes as of late. I think this coupled with getting off meds that might have been inconsistent (liquid Zoloft mixed in with orange juice to now pill form) but I don‚Äôt know what caused a shift. I just stopped trying to make excuses for it and actually tried to own up to it and help myself (not that I hadn‚Äôt before, I was just very gloomy and tense, causing me to be disappointed in everything and making me miserable) I also realized I was bisexual after trying to repress same sex attraction.

1bktg5i,How effective have people found bupropion? :),"Hey! So I‚Äôm pretty against medication, I have anxiety around side effects and not feeling natural and comfortable in my body (I don‚Äôt drink or even take pain killers or anything because I don‚Äôt like not having control over my mind/body). I‚Äôve recently been diagnosed with a brain condition and depression. My brain meds have been fucking amazing and I‚Äôm a bit more open to the idea of trying out medications in general now. 

The only other medication I‚Äôve ever taken really was Lexapro a few years back, the smallest dose (due to my anxiety) and it made no effect whatsoever, positive or negative, couldn‚Äôt even tell I was taking it. 

My doctor is super supportive of my look and anxiety around medications and is happy for me to get a gauge on what I‚Äôm comfortable trying and then getting her approval on it. I‚Äôve been looking into bupropion for several reasons, it seems perfect. 

I‚Äôm a smoker who moved over to vaping. I‚Äôm not actively looking for or trying to quit, but if it happens that‚Äôs neat. I can‚Äôt risk weight gain and I‚Äôm obese due to another medical condition (hormonal) and my obesity caused my brain condition, I quite seriously need to loose weight, if anything. That was my main drive in looking for an antidepressant, as I know a lot cause weight gain. I have excessive fatigue and oversleep due to my depression, 18 hours a day at least. I have no motivation or energy whatsoever and spend my entire life in bed. They are my main and major struggles with my depression, I‚Äôm not sad or suicidal, just incredibly tired and devoid of all interests or emotions. I also not a lot of antidepressants make you tired which is the last thing I need. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs leading me to bupropion.

I don't really think there's much out there for me and I don't really even want to work towards making my life better for myself or improving myself as a human being. Only unfortunate part of my slow spiral is that it sometimes affects other people. I have little sense of self preservation, I have no self worth, and self-destruction is probably my best skill. I don't want kids, I don't really have a desire ro get married, probably won't go to school for a higher education, and I live in my own head daydreaming. I don't make goals or plans because I know I'll give up before I even start. To say that I'll be feel of regrets when I get old is valid, I am already full of regrets now. I feel like I might as well just keep racking them up. Even though I am apparently in control of my life, I feel like that's only a half truth, and to the other half that I believe, I choose to not take control of it. Does it make me bitter? Sure, but not towards other people. Only myself. I believe anybody can practically do anything, unless they're me. I feel like I have this weird backwards ego where I think I'm below everybody no matter what. I don't think any decision I make is ever a right one and I end up regretting everything I do even if it's the ""right"" thing to do. I don't want help anymore, I don't want pity, but what I do want is unattainable, but I have no real desire to improve either. So, I hide how I feel deep down and just carry on, I guess. But sometimes that all you can do, right? I want to live, deep down, not just exist. But then I ask myself if any of it is even worth it. I was nothing, I am nothing, and I'll probably continue to be nothing. I don't trust myself with my own happiness or life, but no one should have to make my decisions for me. I have to take life by the horns, but I'd rather let it run me down. I don't want to fight anymore. It's not worth it to me anymore. I have no right to complain though, since I choose not to fix my problems, but it's nice to vent every so often. I've always heard ""You can either say 'One Day' or 'Day One'.""

1bkrn6w,Cutting people off,"I don't think anyone will want to read this, but I have an issue with cutting people off and I'm just trying to understand the advice a lot of people give that you should cut people off.

I'm gonna give 2 examples of people I've cut off. First is someone I think everyone here would agree I made the right decision on.

So basically my best friend from high school. Eventually he found some other friends and became involved in some criminal activity. So I went from hanging out with him all the time to when he introduced me to his criminal friends, and then I felt the expectation that I also have to get involved in this criminal activity to hang with them. I wasnt going to do that and I wasnt going to accept being downgraded by my best friend so I cut him off.

Was I wrong for that? I really don't think so tbh.

Also it was serious criminality, not just smoking weed etc, which I was doing. it's shit they literally got arrested and charged for pretty recently.

But here's the second instance. Total opposite type of person. Super smart, super professional, and also one of my best friends. But basically what happened is I used to help him with his personal problems, as friends (supposedly) do. And he had quite a few, mostly relationship issues. But I never opened up to him about my personal issues because of my own insecurities, which I know is wrong. But one day we were both opening up and I did open up about my issues, and...I got ignored, basically. Dude basically said ""that sucks bro but...""

So I cut him off.

I already know most of you will say I'm right about the first guy, but I truly feel equally as strongly about the second guy. And yes I got a fake ""I'm sorry if I made you feel..."" apology from him. That cemented my decision to cut him off. Am I wrong? Am I sabotaging myself and my relationships?

1bkqsut,13yo rant!!!,"Alright so for the past couple of years, I've had a terrible experience, everything changed after 2020/Pandemic. 

What happened after the pandemic?
The huge change I haven't seen much talk about, Is that this generation is not well. Most kids daily talk about topics that are stupid, it's coming to the point where the children around me have matured to quickly.. I mean look at this point we got 11yos making jokes about mass tragedies, like racist jokes, or jokes about the twin towers, I get dark humor, but hide it from children... also not just dark jokes, it's also a bunch of adultery, like for example, in my school, cuss words have become normalized, so had uh.. ""weird"" jokes, my fellow students also do this joke around, where the hump the tables.. That is disgusting, also the word gyatt, is always used on my young female teacher.. it's mad weird.. I believe the cause for this huge change was due to kids having too much free time during the pandemic.. This change makes me feel sad.

How do I deal with it?
Well.. I try my best to fit in, as if I find these jokes funny, yet once I arrive home, I feel terrible...

A bit personal..
My family isn't the best either.. my father the other day got into a fight with me, I felt super bad on that day, and I texted my mom about, my dad tracks this, and out of nowhere, I get thrown on the ground and my shirt gets ripped. My brother's alright.. thought he is VERY VERY judgmental.. same with my sister.

Addiction 
I got an Addiction with those videos... It feels terrible.. the urge to watch those is going away but what I did in the past was crazy.. I did it for 5 times a day sometimes.. I don't even know how.. but I regret it.


Summary for people who are lazy like me: 
1. Generation has changed a lot, and it impacts the way I feel, trying to fit in...

2. Well.. I deal with this by going along with this terrible jokes

3. Family is crazy.. dad has OCD, I'm starting to get it, plus anger issues

1bkqs5d,"The more I observe, the more absurd it gets","First post in my long history of creeping. I (F 33) don‚Äôt even know what account this is coming from. 

I am medicated, completed two rounds of TMS, in an intensive outpatient program and none of it is doing much of anything. About 5 years ago I started to feel a slip in my ‚Äúlust for life.‚Äù It was gradual but persistent. I pushed through a demanding job while also getting my mba at night. Committing beyond my limits is a common occurrence in my past life. 

Then I just stopped. More like abruptly halted. While it felt like it came out of nowhere, it‚Äôs been biding its time in the shadows. The intrusive thoughts, the constant internal shaming and insulting, the lack of effort to try and be healthy. For a while I could keep this exile at bay with alcohol or weed, until it overpowered them. 

I had career momentum, supportive family, spouse, etc. logically I tried to understand my depression, not that it‚Äôs possible to be understood. Depression doesn‚Äôt seem to be the right word for it. It‚Äôs a void. I can‚Äôt look away now. I stopped working. I started sleeping all the time. An anxious part of me fought to get help and try to find a path back to something. Anything really. I am fighting what feels like a losing battle. 

I cry constantly, mostly unprovoked. I‚Äôm stuck in the same rut over and over. When I look at my life I can‚Äôt shake how absurd this all is. How wasteful I feel in not being able to look away from the void. It‚Äôs looking at me too. ",Sad_Plantain_1289,8,7,1711081295,depression

1bkqjai,Employment terminated due to mental illness,"I'm really struggling right now.

I was working for a legal aid organisation in my state (I'm in Australia, for context). I have PTSD and I told them that before I started. I had been having some issues at work because most of the work that was done was either dealing with domestic violence, sexual offences, or child abuse. It was pretty triggering. My manager at the time asked for permission to send a letter to my psychiatrist asking what modifications need to be made to help me to do my job. That's how it was pitched to me anyway. So I gave permission.

My manager sent a 4 page letter to my psychiatrist detailing all of the issues with my performance. They said I was inappropriate and rude with clients and stakeholders, and that I was unable to receive feedback, plus other stuff. I disagreed with their assertions, but I went through the process. They asked for further information in January, and my psychiatrist responded. Due to her response, my employment was terminated. They originally told me that it was proposed, but they only gave me a week to respond, which wasn't enough time to get another medical opinion, or legal advice, or even advice from the union. So I had to respond without the benefit of assistance. They refused my counter proposal out of hand, saying that my suggestions were too onerous or unreasonable (I asked for a secondment to a team that doesn't deal with the aforementioned material) and terminated my employment effective immediately. They are allowed to discriminate against me like this because my psychiatrist said I'm unable to fulfill the requirements of the role. So there's no avenue for appealing their decision, or going down the unfair dismissal route (I'm a law student, I read relevant cases while I was waiting for the union to get back to me).

I had also requested to not be on reception more than once per week because people would regularly call wanting legal advice about sexual assault, or trauma dumping about the abuse they suffered and it was upsetting for me. I didn't realise I was painting myself into a corner because work had made decisions to not allow me to undertake any other tasks in my role description except reception because they decided it would be triggering to me without consulting me or even communicating that they had made that decision.

While this was going on, I got my bloodwork updated. it turns out that I am so severely anemic that the HbA1c test they tried to do failed because I didn't have enough hemoglobin available for the test. This probably explains why I've been feeling so exhausted. I've been sleeping a lot. Even though it's been 3 weeks since this all went down, I don't have any appetite and when I do eat, it's not a lot. Oftentimes by the time I get to the end of the day, I'm exhausted and don't have the energy to feed myself. 

I'm waiting for unemployment benefits, which will be another 3 weeks at least. I'm applying for other work, but I've not found anything yet. I'm feeling like I'm losing hope and I am just experiencing periods of being completely beside myself and not able to stop crying or do anything. So I spend most of time trying to keep myself busy, I spend most of my spare time playing video games, which is a helpful distraction.

I'm basically just hoping that I'll find another job and feeling very scared about what's going to happen if I can't find anything. I'm trying to avoid thinking about the future too much because I can't actually cope with the idea of being unemployed. I also have an eating disorder, and not eating is exacerbating that as well, unfortunately.

I don't know how to avoid spiraling. Does any one have any advice?",ziyal79,1,1,1711080469,depression
1bkqej4,I'm disgusted of myself,"Sorry for the grammar and bad format just needed to vent my bad day out. For some context I've been struggling with depression for a while now, mostly about how i view myself. I've been trying to deal with my insecurities and i thought i was doing good for awhile but i just feel like now ive reached my lowest over just a small bad day I had yesterday and i cant pull out.

 I'll admit Ive been pretty stressed out as well the last few years and not sure if that is the main cause of the state of my hair. It has thinned out so much over the last few years  that when I part it, it has like an inch of scalp showing and pulling strands to the side reveals my scalp a lot. When I pull it into a ponytail it's about as thick as a nickel and i cant really even style it that much or style my bangs due to how much its thinned out. It's one of my greatest insecurities along with my weight. 

I've put on quite a bit of weight ever since I had my son but that was 5 years ago and I never have been able to consistently lose it. My depression hasn't been helping and while my partner has said that it doesn't bother them or that they find me attractive, comments like I'm boring or ""like a mom trying to relate to a teenager"" when i talk,  has me sort of spiral out and takes me a long time to get over it than it naturally should. I get stuck in this feeling of feeling old and fat and this ugly old mom when I'm only 24.

I thought I was getting a better handle over these intrusive feelings and insecurities. I got new bangs and felt a bit better about myself and even put on makeup yesterday and styled my hair that I haven't done in a long time.
That same day my partner and I went on a  picnic date but it ended up leading to an argument on the way home. I decided to get some space and headed back out to the park to just go lie on a blanket in the sun and just relax. I found a very secluded spot towards the end of the park with no one around except a group of teenagers hanging out in a gazebo maybe 60 feet away. I started hearing them laughing and talking very loudly poking fun at eachother at first before I started hearing them talk about the ""the big lady in blue"" and making comments about my weight and then just whispering and laughing with eachother.

 I was trying my best to ignore them and just get back to lying down and relaxing and closed my eyes before I heard running steps towards me and opened my eyes just to see one of the boys had leaped over me missing my face by a good few inches before laughing and saying that they just wanted to make sure I wasn't dead. I'm not gonna lie and say I handled it well and im not very proud of it but I called the boy an asshole before just getting in the car and heading home in tears. I don't know what I was expecting I guess some comfort when I got home but my partner was still stressed from our argument and struggles with their bpd and didn't take it very well.  When asked what happened I told them of my run in with the teenagers and they proceeded to get upset over what happened and in their words were trying to help me.  By telling me that I can't stress out over this and then started looking at my head and telling me how bad my bald spot has gotten and that I've let myself go. This had me crying even more and my partner got more stressed and told me, ""I'm just trying to be honest what do you want me to say, that you're beau..."" before stopping.

I'm aware that it's up to you to make sure you keep yourself in shape and that it's not fair to your partner especially since attractionis a major factor for relationships. But I guess I always convinced myself that it was fine because my partner said that my weight never bothered them and that I was fine the way that I am. I feel like the biggest lover and I'm stuck in this loop of resenting what I've allowed myself to become and feeling ugly and unattractive and just being disgusted with myself and then realizing I'm stressing myself out even more and making my balding hair even worse. I think I'm more grossed out of how sensitive I am and let myself just keep eating like shit for years and this whole time fooled myself thinking my partner thought I was attractive or okay with how much I let myself go. I know I got to get over it and start working on my mental and physical health but right now I feel like I can't move and just hate the person I am and can't get overwhelmed by everything that's wrong with me.

1bkpzm2,"my happiness is impossible without the happiness of my parents, it was hypocritical to try to find happiness. I feel like a complete freak","My parents say I just need sex with a woman. I don‚Äôt know. I feel like shit.

I (AMAB20) have experienced feelings of dysphoria since I was about 12 years old, I dreamed of being a girl, wished about it before going to bed, played as female characters, used things to make it seem like I had breasts. I'm not a good masturbator, and I can only feel some kind of arousal if I imagine myself as a girl. I thought it was just a fetish, but by the time I was 18 I was thinking about it literally several times a day.

Recently, the feeling of anxiety has increased greatly, I often have panic attacks, I get very irritated sometimes, I often hurt myself (hitting my head against the wall, biting and cutting my hands). I turned to a doctor for help, after 4 months I received medication. They helped for a while, but they quietly increased my feelings of dysphoria, somehow unbeknownst to me, I began to explore the possibility of becoming trans, looked at other people, and this awakened certain feelings in me. Now it has become difficult for me to think about anything else, I began to sleep poorly (4 hours a day), eat poorly (lost weight from 83 kg to 73 kg), and yesterday I had my first major panic attack after taking medication. I couldn‚Äôt stand it, I called the doctor, they admitted me, and there I told him with great difficulty (in fact, I wrote and showed the text, because it was very hard for me to talk about it) about my desires. The doctor prescribed therapy.

Nevertheless, it was hard for me, I have no friends, good acquaintances, and I only communicate with my parents. I decided to ease my mind a little (without mentioning the last visit to the doctor), talked about therapy and my feelings of anxiety, said that if they knew the truth about me, they would disown me. They thought I was gay and asked if I felt attracted to women, well, yes, I do, just not in the way they thought. After that, they said that all the problems were due to the fact that I didn‚Äôt have sex, and after sex I would relax and stop worrying.

They promised to find me a girl, and I felt like complete crap because I couldn't tell them the whole truth. Sometimes I regret so much that I was born at all, lately I dream of falling asleep and never waking up (I'm too cowardly to kill myself, if I had the courage, I would have done it long ago, it would have only saved everyone people from my problems, anyway my life doesn‚Äôt have much meaning, no one will worry if I die, especially if I write in a note about my feelings, everyone will even be happy). 

They also asked to share with them their next visit to the therapist. So I decided that I would tell the therapist that my thoughts were just delusions, a momentary clouding, and I would feel better and would refuse therapy. It was very hypocritical to think that I could find happiness through therapy, but this happiness is impossible without the happiness of my parents. So I decided to just suppress all these feelings. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm writing this, I just need to express myself somewhere.

Anyway, I kept getting side tracked, but he would be like 'anyway' and the continue on.

I didn't mind it one bit. I cried twice texting him. He got sm info out of me mannn. 

I told him about my 'mommy issues' which before I didn't realize until I started talking about it and realized that 'mommy issues' isnt having your mom run away, or physical abuse, and it isn't always black and white with the term 'mommy issues'. Later I'll deny my issues but I know right now what's good for me.

I told him I felt recognized and that he made me cry twice happily.   
He told me that when I was talking about a previous best friend of mine I sounded lonely and sad about it, and that my story was really saddening. 

I feel bad about that, like maybe I overshared? I don't really know exactly how much of my life someone can take because I thought this was everyone. Is it not? 

I used to think he was annoying but the more I know him the more I see past him. Only people who feel like I do can be that good of a damn therapist.

1bkpam6,One step back,"I thought that I was doing fine. I've spent 8 years working through my anxiety and depression. But lately I'm not sure if it's my head or if I'm actually ill. Lately the past couple months I've been going through some things. Unhappy with my marriage, distancing myself with my friends, not really wanting to eat even though I love cooking, arguments at work. I'm prescribed adderall and it hasn't really been helping me lately. 

I have no motivation. I really want to end my marriage because my husband treated me like shit that I don't feel like myself. I feel like there's a hole missing in my heart.  I'm struggling paying the bills while my husband's trying to find a job. I have no more enjoyment anymore. My job is incredibly stressful, I work in surgery so I constantly have to think. I feel unattractive and don't even crave sex anymore even though sex is the only thing that makes me happy. 

Lately I feel so tired that I can't wake up in the mornings. I have to be dragged out of bed even though I wake easily to any noise. I always feel like im going go pass out at work because of not eating even though I do eat just not as much lately. I haven't lost any weight and I still can't look at myself. 

I just do really feel ill and idk how to get any better. Literally nothing sounds like fun anymore and I avoid social situations. How do I get past this? And I can't afford a therapist or therapy.

1bkp1vg,Why does my mom make everything about her?,"
Firstly, I wanna say that I love her and it isn‚Äôt like I don‚Äôt have good moments with her. She and my dad bring me and my siblings on trips and buys me whatever I want. I‚Äôm extremely grateful for all of this and I know that a lot of teens have it way worse but I just can‚Äôt be in the same room as her sometimes. I‚Äôm very easy to upset, very sensitive and like most people I do like it when things go my way. I know it‚Äôs normal for a teenage girl to argue with their moms but that doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt an issue right? 
My mom makes most things about her. I know that she had a tough childhood but I don‚Äôt see why she should continue the cycle. She refuses to speak when I‚Äôm not looking at her, she will legit get pissed when my family are having a conversation (a normal one that she can join in at any time) because no one is giving her attention, gets angry when one of us cuts her off but will do the same thing and see nothing wrong with it, she gets angry that ‚Äúno one‚Äù helps her but will continue to complain even after someone did, will criticize what I like doing but will become extremely defensive if I call her out on it, she gets mad at the flick of a finger. One moment she‚Äôll be calm and before you know it, she‚Äôs screaming the house down. I can‚Äôt get a single word out or defend myself because in her eyes I am ALWAYS in the wrong. There is no ‚Äúwinning‚Äù with her. She‚Äôll do anything to make you feel bad, she‚Äôll call herself a terrible mother and tell us how she feels like leaving and never coming back. She‚Äôll tell us how she‚Äôs a slave in this house (literally for taking care of us like a mother should) and call us names. She‚Äôs called us retards, she hit me on the head (I was pissed and trying to sleep and my siblings were making noises, I thought my brother entered my room so I turned and said shut the fuck up, turns out it was my mom and she ran at me while screaming and kept slapping my head) she‚Äôs tried to push me off a chair when I refused to defend my aunt who is a terrible person. She‚Äôs is constantly stressed out, it feels like she makes everything about her and I know that she‚Äôs just struggling but I can‚Äôt deal with it. The thing that angered me off the most was when I went to the hospital (mental health issues) and while I could tell there was genuine concern for me and she wanted me to get better, I can‚Äôt say I enjoyed how that entire year and even still now she makes it about her. She‚Äôll tell me how much it affected her and talk about how much money she spent on me.

1bknldm,Hoy fue un d√≠a igual a los anteriores,"He estado internada un par de veces por intento de suicidio, y puedo decir que las personas encargadas dan de alta a pacientes que no siempre est√°n estables del todo para salir, como yo. Me dieron de alta una vez, y a√±os despu√©s me volvieron a internar, me dieron de alta por segunda vez, y despu√©s volv√≠ a intentarlo, hasta la √∫ltima vez, que fui internada en un centro para mujeres con problemas de no s√© qu√© tipo.
Pero ah√≠ no ne dieron de alta, yo ped√≠ que me sacaran porque era horrible estar ahi, una de las psic√≥logas insultaba de una manera horrible a una de mis compa√±era que ten√≠a anorexia y bulimia, y le dec√≠a que estaba fea o que parec√≠a un hueso o cosas por el estilo. En realidad nunca me gust√≥ ese lugar y creo que mis padres se dieron cuenta de eso, por eso decidieron sacarme. No me enorgullezco por las veces que intent√© suicidarme, se que le hice da√±o a mis padres y no me hace feliz ser consciente de eso, pero nunca tuve la intenci√≥n de fallar a prop√≥sito para no morir en todas esas veces que lo intent√©. Inclusive la √∫ltima vez que lo intente, pens√© que iba a ser la definitiva, que esa vez si iba a funcionar y que ya no iba a tener que lidiar con todo este asco y tristeza que siento por todo. Pero parece que tomarme 68 pastillas de las que encontr√© en el botiqu√≠n de la casa no fueron suficientes para terminar con mi vida.
Quiz√°s si me hubiera tomado 100 hubiera funcionado, pero ya no hab√≠an m√°s pastillas. Recuerdo un d√≠a que termin√© en un hospital pero esa vez, no fue por intento de suicidio, sino porque estaba tan triste que me tome una botella entera de vodka sin agua. Al parecer me choc√≥ porque no recuerdo nada y al d√≠a siguiente termin√© en un hospital (olvid√© decir que los odio), sin saber porque estaba ah√≠. Me dijeron que estuve apunto de entrar en un coma etilico; pero no pas√≥. En fin, solo quer√≠a recordar todo esto y desahogarme un poco. A√∫n que eso no quite que me sienta igual o que lo quiera hacer de nuevo. Cuando lo hice por primera vez ten√≠a 15 a√±os, en ese entonces dure casi un a√±o sin verme en ning√∫n espejo, ni en mi cuarto, ni en la calle, ni en los reflejos de las botellas, cucharas o cosas as√≠. Y creo que estaba menos ansiosa porque no me ve√≠a la cara, pero era terrible cuando accidentalmente me ve√≠a.
Autom√°ticamente lloraba o me pon√≠a muy triste y no quer√≠a hacer nada por el resto del d√≠a o quiz√°s hac√≠a las cosas pero casi sin ganas de nada, sin ganas de estar viva. El compararme con otras personas, especialmente chicas se hizo algo frecuente, no puedo dejar de sentirme inferior y fea cuando veo a otra chica, de la edad que sea y se vea como se vea.
En mi cabeza siempre soy yo la m√°s fea. Nunca he tenido enamorado en persona. Y hubo un tiempo en  

el que me deprim√≠ porque pens√© que nunca nadie se iba a fijar en m√≠ por tener la cara que tengo, pensaba que me iba a quedar sola toda mi vida a pesar de que, no dir√≠a sue√±o, pero, uno de mis anhelos en la vida es conocer a una persona que me ame tal y como soy y me vea como alguien bonita o suficiente para el. Pensar en que quiz√°s tener algo bonito y sincero con alguien no est√° destinado para m√≠ me da mucha tristeza y quiz√°s un poco de celos por las personas que si pueden o si tienen la oportunidad de tener algo as√≠. Ahora ya no pienso que sea imposible del todo, pero si poco probable quiz√°s. A√∫n que mi mayor preocupaci√≥n no es eso, sino seguir teniendo la cara que tengo y tener que levantarme todos los d√≠as igual tratando de aparentar que todo est√° bien conmigo, que no me pasa nada y que estoy bien cuando realmente estoy pensando en acabar con mi vida. Nunca entend√≠ porque hay personas que me dec√≠an que era bonita sin pregunt√°rselos jam√°s, o porque hab√≠an chicos que me lo dec√≠an, nunca entend√≠ y no entiendo como puede haber personas as√≠. A veces pienso que esas personas, que me dijeron en su momento que soy bonita o me dan cumplidos sin ninguna raz√≥n, solo lo hacen por pena o l√°stima hacia m√≠. Y no lo digo solo por personas de mi familia, sino por chicos del colegio, de la universidad o del trabajo. Nunca acept√© salir con ninguno de los chicos que me propusieron salir, y no porque no me parec√≠an lindos, muchos de ellos eran realmente muy guapos, pero creo que me da algo de miedo salir con un chico (pese a que me gustar√≠a tener pareja en alg√∫n momento de mi vida). Siento que solo quieren jugar conmigo o que al final terminar√°n haci√©ndome da√±o o cambi√°ndome por una m√°s bonita. Creo que no quiero sentir m√°s dolor del que yo misma me hago sentir cada d√≠a, eso ser√≠a demasiado. Nunca he tenido una amiga, bueno, en realidad tuve una de 6to de primaria pero ya no nos hablamos porque me cambi√© de colegio y tuve otra (creo) en 1ro de secundaria, pero tampoco nos hablamos por el mismo motivo. Yo he pasado por muchos colegios, mis padres, mi hermano y yo nos mud√°bamos constantemente y no recuerdo haber durado m√°s de un a√±o en alg√∫n colegio, a excepci√≥n del √∫ltimo en el que estuve que fue un colegio de mujeres, en el que dure los √∫ltimos 4 a√±os de secundaria antes de entrar a la universidad, y en esos 4 a√±os no hice ni una sola amiga, lo cual es bastante triste y ahora me arrepiento de no haberlo intentado en vez de estarme comparando con todas mis compa√±eras de sal√≥n. En fin, solo quer√≠a recordar todo esto y desahogarme un poco. A√∫n que eso no quite que me siento igual que antes. Pero creo que a√∫n tengo la esperanza de que en alg√∫n momento las cosas mejoren para m√≠ y poder vivir una vida normal y tranquila, sin preocupaciones por mi cara y sin tenerle miedo a los espejos.

My family is completely horrible, always judging, always body shaming me, saying I can reach out to them for help, but then create an environment where the last thing I would want to do is reach out. I have 1 close friend who is always there for me, but I feel like all I am is a burden to him. I started dating for 4 months and I thought things where looking better for me, but I was just a desperate fool unable to notice the abuse and neglect in the relationship, and didn't notice how unhealthy it was, and despite how self destructive it was, I still battle with feelings whether or not I love him or not. Some days I hate him for how horrible he's treated me, others I wish I got another chance to be with him. I keep spiralling, I keep losing motivation to do anything, I've been eating incredibly little, I stopped doing any exercise, I stopped talking to anyone other than the 1 friend and brushing of others that try to talk to me, cos I feel like none of them are sincere and genuine, and I hate myself for how pathetic I am, and for how jealous I am of everyone around me that is better than me at everything. The idea of just making the pain stop with a couple pills is both terrifying and enticing. I want the pain to stop, but I know I will inflict pain on my family and friends, but I simultaneously don't feel like any of them are genuine, so what does it matter if i die? They wont care anyway.

But I don't feel like I have it in me to get better. And, that's made me feel more depressed imo. Like, as sad as it sounds I had this thought of that...it's cheaper to just...not be, instead of suffering through it and trying to get out of abuse for example. 

I was lucky enough to recieve a therapy call session recently and the although the lady therapist was really sharp & professional and lovely - she was also imo really blunt with me and stated very bluntly that ""you have to fight for your life"". But again...what if I don't have it in me anymore? Again I am very grateful for the call session but feel sad deep down about all this.

Whatever it is that's missing feels deeper than just drive and motivation. I don't know what it is though but everyone seems to have it and I don't feel it in me anymore...

You must understand that my father has always been rather stoic with me, so seeing him begging was very impactful....I mean,I was convinced and still am that my father raised me not out of love but rather for a sense of duty or in honor of my mother.  What I am trying to say that we have never been closed. Regardless of my attempt I could never been the male son that he wanted or deserved. So having such strong reaction from him was surprising. Continuing the story, my father made me promise that as long he lives I can't end myself. So I tried to get better , I followed the classical guideline to deal with depression. I went to a psychiatrist, I started medical treatment, psicological counseling and changed in life style(more sport,new diet ecc.). Also i decided to restart college and take my degree. I wanna make it clear that I put some major effort in solving ,but regardless of all this ""effort"" my condition didn't get better .

I've always figured that I've had depression from the way I feel and act, and recently, I'm even more convinced. Literally within the last hour I went magnet fishing with my dad, and I feel nothing.

 Everything was perfect. It was my preferred weather(rain), it was fun to get out of the house and explore, we even managed to catch a few rusty hooks and some small iron pebbles, but I still don't feel happy. I felt more joy imagining how it would go down (the exact scenario that actually happened), than when I actually got the chance to do it.

This happens all the time whenever I do something fun like going to the state fair, doing something fun on the rare chance I get to see my brothers, or even go to a Renaissance festival. No matter what I do, I just feel empty afterwards. 

I have no friends, no opportunities to make friends because I'm an online student, I don't like being alive(thankfully I'm not suicidal), and I barely have a reason to live other than just living. I've already mentioned my depression to my parents, but of course, that didn't go anywhere.

1bkkjaz,My Journey so far‚Ä¶,"I wrote this as a comment to another post, but felt maybe my journey is worth sharing on its own. 

I‚Äôve fought depression and intrusive thoughts my entire life (33m). I‚Äôve always been chunkier than my friends, even when I‚Äôm in decent fit shape I look chunky if you see me with clothes on. I struggle with social anxiety and anxiety in general, I never feel fully confident in myself and I struggle with meeting new people.  I‚Äôve always felt inadequate, even when the world tells me I‚Äôm good, and I‚Äôve had this ‚Äúwhy me?‚Äù victim mentality for years. 

Last year, I got out of a relationship with someone I assumed to be my life partner after 11 years. It wasn‚Äôt because of my issues, she was always supportive of that, but it fucking destroyed me and put me in the lowest low of my life. It motivated me to get real help, and find the best me. Learning to recognise my triggers through professional help was my first big step. It took me 3 different therapists to find one that I clicked with.

For me any form of social media binging is my biggest trigger, to the point that I now put a timer on for like 45mins or something to stop me falling into an episode.  I‚Äôll then switch it up to do some chores, read a book or go for a walk etc.

I make sure to try and stay socially engaged with my friends, even when I don‚Äôt feel like it. I‚Äôve always hated ‚Äúalone time‚Äù until I started working hard on it recently.

I‚Äôve learned what ‚Äúself care‚Äù means to me. I love to mountain bike personally (even though sometimes I resent going, that‚Äôs normal), so I started building myself a self care routine around that. I‚Äôll go out and interact with the world to get a coffee etc, go for my ride, go for a sandwich at my favourite deli and then have some downtime. Then I‚Äôll reassess what I feel motivated to do that evening.

I‚Äôm learning that I have amazing qualities to my personality, and that I‚Äôm a beautiful person in my own way. I‚Äôm not perfect, but who is? People who portray themselves as ‚Äúrock solid‚Äù and show no vulnerability are the ones with the biggest insecurities.  The most toxic trait of depression is comparing yourself to others who are ‚Äúdoing great‚Äù. I‚Äôve started thinking ‚Äúfuck them, I‚Äôm on my journey‚Äù. They all have issues and are probably thinking I have no issues.

I‚Äôm learning to communicate much more clearly, and that I can just say ‚Äòno‚Äô without a BS excuse when I don‚Äôt want to do something. I‚Äôm learning that me doing a favour/gesture for someone doesn‚Äôt mean they have to return it. I‚Äôm seeing that putting myself out there should be done from a place of love, not to get something in return. 

I‚Äôm 100% still a WIP, and I still have days where I can‚Äôt even do life, but the changes I‚Äôve felt in the last few months are unlike anything ever felt in my entire adult life. The world looks like a much better place, I‚Äôm feeling more confident in my own unique self and I‚Äôm looking forward to the rest of the journey ahead of me.

 I‚Äôve even noticed how my own happiness draws people to me, friends and dates. People actually enjoy being around me when I‚Äôm my true self, that means a lot to me.

1bkk512,My therapist made me feel so bad I am still mad about it,"Sorry this is kinda long, I just need to say this somewhere. 

It has been months since I attempted to go to 
a work healthcare therapist, overall it's been years since I wanted to go to therapy at all. 
I have a long history with mental health problems, long term depression and major anxiety disorder are the biggest things I suppose, I've worked through so many things and my life has changed so much for the better over the years. 
But I do have issues with self esteem that I just seem to never be able to get over. It's starting to affect my life again and I really want to not feel so shitty about myself all the time. 

So this recent thing just won't stop coming back to me. I hate it, and it makes me feel like I was stupid for trying to get back to therapy. So I just need to let it out somewhere since I keep these things a secret from pretty much everyone irl.

I had a couple of sessions, mostly because my anxiety and self hatred got so bad I started to have panic attacks at work. The first couple of times were fine, basic things u know. Thought exercises and going through stuff that I can try to get over my negative self talk. 

But the last time I saw the therapist just kinda broke me. 

So I have this thing where if I get too many work hours I completely begin to fall apart, I'm talking normal people hours are too much for me. I work in retail so sometimes I have double the work hours in a week. 
The session was on my one day off in the middle of the week and I was already shaking and crying when I got there because I was so stressed, tired and anxious. I cry easily, I can have 5 panic attacks a day on bad times, so this was not a good time for me. I hoped it would make me feel a little better to talk about it so I still went. 

She did not know what to say to me. It was awkward as hell sitting there in silence when she just stared at me and asked If I was going to keep crying. She asked questions to get my mind off of things I suppose but the thing is. I cry so hard if I think about good things while panicking because it makes me feel guilty, 

I told her that, but she wanted me to talk about stuff I did with my friends that week. I had a bit of a breakdown then and there. I kept shaking and bouncing my legs while crying hysterically. I said I was sorry to be like that instead of getting the proper words out, and I tried to calm myself down with breathing exercises. 

She just stared at me. She looked so offended that I was even there. 
Then after I got myself to calm down I said some stupid joke about it all and laughed a bit. she just stared at me and sighed in frustration. ‚ÄúI don't get what is there for you to cry about, we were talking about good things.‚Äù Then she just stared at me, like I was stupid or something. 

I just said that sorry, I feel like I don't deserve good things and it just overwhelmed me. 

She scoffed at that. Then said ‚ÄúHonestly I don't understand what you want me to say to you anymore, you should have stayed home today.‚Äù 

I don't even remember much after that. I thanked her for the previous sessions and left. I stared at my walls for the rest of that day. 

It's been months but I can't stop thinking about that moment. I quit my meds too and I really should go see a doctor again but I can't bring myself to schedule a time. I feel so humiliated. I feel disgusted by myself for wasting anyone's time. Now I want to hide my problems again and that makes me feel so mad at everything since I haven't felt this bad in a while. Was I really so wrong for wanting therapy again? I feel so humiliated.

1bkk1l4,I wish that I could kill myself but something won‚Äôt let me..,"(23M) For the past 4 years, I have been going strong on a losing streak. Since 2020, I‚Äôve striving to achieve ANYTHING!! Graduating university, losing weight and being attractive, be consistent in my artwork/Youtube, revive my athletic career, build some savings and maybe finally start dating again lol. However, I‚Äôm failing everyone and it‚Äôs ALL my fault. 

Here‚Äôs the thing, on paper‚Ä¶I‚Äôm doing everything right. 
* I have a decent job in my home town that fits in my psychology field.
* For the past 3 years‚Ä¶ I was about 330lbs, as of my I‚Äôm back in the 200s at 280lbs. Even though I‚Äôll probably ruin my progress soon. 
* After being dismissed and fucked over a few years back, I‚Äôm about 3 semesters (not counting summer classes) from graduating with a bachelors. Doing‚Ä¶better academically??

Not even trying to be self-deprecating but‚Ä¶I‚Äôm a pussy. All of my bullies were right! I can‚Äôt finish anything that I started and was properly estimated. Sure, I have friends! Friends that I love to death. Although, the things that we love ‚Ä¶don‚Äôt always love you back or the same way. There hobbies and outlets for me, but I CAN‚ÄôT take my foot off the gas now.
* If I don‚Äôt receive a B average by this semester end, I‚Äôll get dismissed again! Not to mention, I probably just failed one of my midterms. 
* My stepfather is retiring soon so my mom and I are going to have a rougher time helping pay for school. 
* A good chunk of my friends are graduating soon and I‚Äôll be here by myself. 
* Therapy hasn‚Äôt really helped me either. They want me on meds but I don‚Äôt want to live my life relying on that stuff. 

I just can‚Äôt stop myself. Let me be completely honest with all of you, there are times where I just want to end myself! (I wrote my second suicide note last night). If things won‚Äôt change if stop trying, then why tf haven‚Äôt they? Trying is the reason why I‚Äôm here in this hellhole alone. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs two people in my mind. One of them yells:

‚ÄúWhy are you STILL trying?!‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy do keep on letting yourself and others down?‚Äù 
‚ÄúAre you trying to prove everyone that said that you‚Äôre a soft, mediocre, pathetic and ugly waste of sperm correct?‚Äù 
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre 23! Being a shy, awkward dork has NEVER been cute. Nobody wants that.‚Äù

Every time before that voice finally pushes me to swallow those pills or  buy that gun‚Ä¶the other voice makes a comeback. My spirit still wants me to prove others wrong and is determined to make something of myself! My spirit wants to give every obstacle and non-believer the middle finger and tell them to ‚ÄúSTFU!!l‚Äù Someone that‚Äôs loved, has pride to their name and that‚Äôs an overall decent person that didn‚Äôt sell their soul. 

Sorry for this is being SOOO long. I don‚Äôt blame you for not reading any of it. I just needed to get that all out of me! Wish me luck on this amateur strongman competition this Saturday. Even though I won‚Äôt win, I hope that I push myself to the point of heart attack.

I dont know seriously i cant sort my shit out
I mentally tired everytime,

I have the skills but im not doing anything to improve it

Will i be like this forever
I have reached a point where i cant control it 
I feel like just giving in

What is happening, I feel actually scared of myself 
I am afraid i am gonna do lot of messed up and immoral things in my life and I am gonna die with regrets

I dont know if i want to be good

1bkja3b,Giving this shit like 4 more years.,"Sorry to add on to all  the negative posts and whatnot but I'm just tired man. Ping. Pong. Ping. Pong. Happy. Sad. Happy. Sad. I genuinely do not want to try to get better at this point because that takes time and effort and I suck at everything. If it doesn't fix itself, I'm gonna solve the problem. Tired of little things ruining my mood. I didn't ask for a brain this fucking complicated.

Ya wanna know another fucked up thing? I almost hate that everyone's attitude has changed when it comes to mental health. Like logically, I know it's better. I know it's beneficial and I want EVERYONE ELSE to be happy. The problem is, I finally adapted to the more negative society. I had it. And then, everyone flipped it. ""True strength is vulnerability"" and all that shit. It hits hard. Feels like a fucking attack on my fucking person. 

Also, lets get real for a second. NO ONE likes me. Nope. No one at all. I'm an undesirable race, an undesirable gender, and I hide all this negativity underneath. People like me get shit on all the time for struggling. They let us know just how much they don't like us. As for the other two, I realize that I will pay for the sins of my forefathers as well as the sins of my peers. When people look at me when I'm out, they don't see me. No. They probably just see some opportunistic criminal. Doesn't help that I picked up a lot of slang words.

But maybe I deserve it. I'm not a good person. I'm really not. I've had thoughts that I shouldn't have. I've done things that I shouldn't have. Sometimes, I silently sympathize with the evil. I'm not a good person. I'm just valueless trash. Part of me wants to stop trying. To prove everyone right. To justify every stereotype and fear.

I must not run away, but people are tiring, I'm fucking exhausted. I should isolate.

My suffering looks endless. Instead of isolating, I should die. I want the suffering to end. If I isolate, it could hurt people, but if I died, I wouldn't care. Unfortunately, I can't k1ll myself. Knifes always look like the solution, and I'm not able to even harm myself. 

Taking decision is tiring. Maybe my issues with decision are combined with my mommy issues. Maybe I want someone to take care of me, to reassure me, to make choice for me. Maybe I want a person who'd be a lover and a mother figure. Or maybe I'm just fucked up by milf hentai. I don't know anymore. 

I must not run away, I must not. I'm not normal, I should be able to watch one of my favorite series, I should feel this way with it. It happened once, only once, but once, I needed to imagine someone feeding me because I was hungry but not motivated to eat. It happened once, probably at my worst. Now, I just hug my pillow. I also use my imagination, try to push myself in some dreams. 

I don't know if I should apologize to people, or if them who are wrong. I try to think about it in many ways, and never reach the same conclusion. And again, people have different opinions on it. Some tell me I'm a dick, others tell me I'm a victim, there also are those who says we're all wrong and those who says none are wrong.

There's nothing I live for. Yet, I'm still alive. An hour ago, I was outside, it's late. I rarely do this. Maybe I had hope that something would happen to me, an accident. 

Sometimes I'm hungry and eat a lot. But I regret. I'm not fat, but I'm not skinny enough. I try to achieve my dream physic, but it's impossible. I'm not sad because I'm born a male, I'm sad because I'm born with a male-look. Sometimes, I wanna be a girl, but I also like being a boy. I can't actually be kind of both, I can't change and turn myself whenever I want. Maybe I don't even want that after all. Is it me ?

1bkhqh4,Depression as a defense mechanism against something worse?,"Hi!

Been depressed since I was in first grade, maybe even kindergarten if that's possible.

The last 5 years has been a battle (all the years have been really). It was when my first child was born that I realized something was wrong. To be in pain and doing everything I can to avoid it in every waking hour had worked ok minus up until then. Averaging a year, I could be performing ok for 8 months, I can do this, I just have to push through. No serene calm moments, only trying to escape.  


During these last 5 years I have tried to keep calm. Accept the hurt, not fighting, sit there and take it. God damn it hurts. Now I am here. After all those minutes, hours, days, weeks, years, not getting ANY better. Counting the the number of times psychologists have nodded their head at me would be like counting the stars in the beautiful midnight sky. I think I know the reason for this depression though. A difficult childhood with no huge traumas, but just a general feeling of not ever being safe or even being taken care of and a huge dose of everything feeling like a big pile of sh... or chaos. I was always on watch for threats for some reason, and have been always.  


The child that was happy, eager, looking forward to every day with a huge amount of energy suddenly became this calm, controlled and quiet shell of itself. I have been searching for answers for so long and I think I may be on to something??? This is where I need your input.

Google can be your friend I have heard. Maybe less now than before, but the search ""Depression the body's way to protect itself"" gave some insightful hits. (For me this is a new train of thought, I never saw depression as a symptom, just the illness itself)  


This article ""[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/shouldstorm/202012/we-ve-got-depression-all-wrong-it-s-trying-save-us](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/shouldstorm/202012/we-ve-got-depression-all-wrong-it-s-trying-save-us)"" describes something that I feel in my core. I recently experienced anxiety like never before after I got really ill from a virus that just teared me down like nothing else. My two kids, who have not turned 6 yet had to go a whole day with a packet of crackers. I was unable to take care of them. This is also were my defenses, my depression and my flight responses had to bow, my brain did no longer have the energy to ""use"" depression as a defense mechanism. 

What happens when the defense is gone? The real threat appears. The one that has been hidden for almost 30 fucking years! The anxiety. This feeling of terror and nothingness. The feeling that the whole existence is in danger, my kids, my fianc√©e, my life, my efforts, everything in my life was just not important, existence was this fleeting feeling of vulnerability and even not existing at all. Everything felt as it could disappear in a second. Nothing lasts more than a second in the universes' time scale.  


**So sorry for the looong f' read. I just hope someone can offer their thoughts on this subject. Can depression be a defense mechanism against something far worse?** Something that really disables the body from doing any action? I swear, when my body was immobilized by this anxiety I could do nothing, not anything at all. With depression I can hurt and hurt and hurt and have moments of strength were I can cook, mow the lawn and other small tasks, if even for just an hour of a week. I have been through pills and alcohol - nothing works as you know, it's just trying to cope, whatever it takes.

I‚Äôve come close twice to ending my life in the past 48 hours. He was my life. Life just isn‚Äôt worth living without him. I tried talking to him, but his mind is made up. I couldn‚Äôt sleep last night. I kept waking up from nightmares of him with other girls and being so happy and loving with them. I shivered and sweat all night long, bawling my eyes out.

We planned to move away and start our own family.

I‚Äôm blind-sided. He tells me that we‚Äôre just too different from each other. (Aren‚Äôt many people in good relationships different from each other?) My head is swirling trying to remember details. We have little arguments and fights over stupid things, and I‚Äôve learned that I start most of them, but I‚Äôve been getting better at resisting and just becoming more chill and sensitive. We‚Äôre both stressed and exhausted. He says he‚Äôs tired of all of the fights. I always try to help him with anything, and he spoiled me. I would clean his house when he didn‚Äôt have time. He says we‚Äôre toxic. I promised him things would change. I gave him some time but I couldn‚Äôt keep myself from him. I got him his favorite breakfast and a nice coffee (he loves coffee) this morning and tried to figure things out, mend them. I tried to stay calm.

We‚Äôre done. You need to go home now.‚Äù He‚Äôs not one to really cry and show emotions like that. I‚Äôm his opposite, and I cry all the time over everything.

 I fucked up so bad. He told me to go date other guys and forget about him. He told me that he‚Äôs already begun to forget about me. I could never. I could never move on and date other guys. I love him with everything in me. I love him so much. I‚Äôm lost. I wish I had a Time Machine.

I'm clinically depressed and during previous episodes my partner has been the one person it didn't take effort to be with, but now... I don't know what's changed but I feel like talking with him is exhausting. I've tried to ignore it but I'm just being such a bitch...

1bkelgt,i've been completely avoiding life and i don't want to get back to it because i don't want life anyway.,"i feel like a lot of this is just a repeat of my previous post and i feel so fucking stupid for being so redundant and crying for help.

i haven't been to school or work all week. i know how to do the whole ""hey sorry i've been gone, i've been dealing with mental health issues. is there any way i can catch up on xyz?"" because i've done it so many times before--i'm not posting this for help or advice, i just don't want to do any of that. i don't want to return to anything, i just want to die.

i feel like dying would solve all those issues without effort and it's very obviously a solution to the desire to not be alive. i'm so sick of trying to bide my time before i die, everything's just so fucking useless and pointless. i know life is meaningless anyway, but living every day and trying to create meaning while trying to finding ways to cope is just filling time before i die. i'm so tired of it. why the fuck am i doing any of that when the obvious solution is death?? it's like i'm taking the long unwanted journey instead of the immediate path, how does that make any sense???

i feel pathetic because a lot of the time the only exciting things in my life are have crushes or romantic and sexual relationships, but nothing ends up working out. i either end up feeling used or unhappy, or the more i get to know someone, the more i realize i don't even want a relationship with them. it's so fucking lonely and isolating. i don't think i'll ever have a satisfying relationship with anyone, whether it's family or friends or a partner.

i want to get back to the point of at least looking forward to getting outside and enjoying it while i'm out there, but for now all it's doing is serving as a distraction. i don't want to just be distracted or put so much fucking effort into coping, it's so fucking stupid and difficult.

if i'm going to live i should make the most of it because it's such a weird and rare thing considering the scope of the universe, but i don't have the motivation or energy or even the desire lately. i felt like i was having such an upward trajectory for a couple months, but having deep lows like this is just a reminder that i'm probably going to feel this way forever.",drumass,1,0,1711048108,depression
1bkejd2,I'm on the verge of burnout. What can I do?,"Hello everyone,

I know that burnout might not really be a type of depression, but I don't know where else to go.

I (34 F), work as a Technical Consultant for a fairly big company. Since I have many years of expertise, my rank is ""Senior"", so I am usually a source of help for other colleagues who need assistance.

I currently have 7 projects where I implement technical solutions for our customers. I have phases where I am extremely productive, wake up early, get a lot of things done. However, I'm currently in a phase where it is extremely hard for me to work. I feel the burden even more because as a Senior I'm a valuable ressource of the company and some projects will literally never move along if I don't work on them. I am both grateful and scared of being in this position. I've worked so hard all my life to get to where I am. I'm single, earn extremely well, live alone and have the best ever relationship with my family. They never ask for it, but I always give them money just so they can have it easier in life and I do it happily. I recently bought my parents a house too. All of these things fulfill me and it's a way for me to express my gratitude towards my parents who raised me. I have no thoughts of self-harm or suicide at all, I am usually very fun-loving and active.

I've been doing this job for 8 years already and the first few years, I was going to the office and wasn't allowed to take the laptop home. Homeoffice wasn't a thing back then. However, ever since the pandemic, working from home has become a big thing and now we work 100% homeoffice. Of course I love it, I can be with my cat, can accept packages when they arrive, can do my laundry, the dishes, etc in between meetings when I find a few minutes and don't have to leave it all for after work, which gives me more time to relax after work. All of this is nice, but for a few months now I've been in an extreme slump. I can't motivate myself to work hard, I don't have any fun doing the job I once loved, I keep postponing everything (and I mean everything) I work on, so bad that it exceeds the delivery date and never gets delivered unless a C-level person literally yells at me to get my sh\*t together. At this point, I'm just surprised they didn't fire me yet because I messed up quite a few times.

My colleagues notice it, my family notices it, I only ever want to sleep, I keep finding reasons to take a nap in the middle of the day (I nap every single working day, for at least 2-3 hours). I used to wake up at 5 AM every morning to go to the gym, but those days feel so far away (even though I was just like that up until the beginning of the year). I don't understand what's happening and I'm really scared of losing my job, but even the fear of losing my job can't bring me to work on anything.

I tried visiting the office once a week in the last month and I noticed I can work a bit better from there but nobody besides me goes there. It's literally a huge building with not a single soul in it. I have the keys to the office and I'm the only one there. It depresses me when I don't see my colleagues face to face. Seeing and interacting with people raises my spirits and makes me work harder (just like going to the gym and seeing other people workout motivates me to workout more than following a workout video on Youtube at home). But it's impossible for me because everyone prefers Homeoffice. It went so far that I even considered the worst: quitting my job at this company and moving to another company where they have less Homeoffice, but even though I've been looking for weeks, I can't find any company like that that's not too far away for me to go to every day. The area I work in just generally does not have a high Office-Working quote.

I'm on the verge of having a burnout, all the symptoms I have clearly point to it and I've made an appointment with my therapist about it, but it's not until a few weeks later due to her busy schedule.

What can I do, how can I prevent myself from feeling such fatigue and exhaustion and how can I get out of the slump I'm in? I feel useless for my company. And the more I feel like this, the more I realize that I define my self-worth through my work, because I feel like I have nothing else in life that will keep me upright. If I give up working and take a sabbatical, I feel like I'll entirely let go and lose myself. I need a routine and a strict office policy to keep me away from home. I even thought about just leaving my laptop at the office so that I'd be forced to go there the next day...

I know it's very long, please forgive me, but I really need help. I don't think I'm in a state where I need medical help, but I'm sure that if I keep doing this for another 1-2 weeks, I will be in a full blown burnout and I want to prevent it. At this point, I'm just happy I recognized the symptoms before it was too late. Please let me know your thoughts and thank you for reading.",Adventurous-Owl-8478,1,0,1711047960,depression

1bkeg0f,I am not supposed to exist,"My mother loves me more than anything. I am her only child and can‚Äôt stand to see me hurt, so I would never do anything to hurt myself. But my god do I feel like it sometimes. 

My father had been married before he met my mother so I have two half sisters. They are 10 and 15 years older than me. I idolized my sisters when I was younger, but they have always disliked me and my mother. They blame my mother for the divorce (all though my parents met while my dad was in the middle of divorce) and by proxy they blame me. Growing up it felt like my dad favored my sisters, because he would try to make up for the divorce. In fact my mother wasn‚Äôt allowed to tell anyone about her pregnancy with me until four months because he didn‚Äôt know how to brake the news to my sisters. My sisters always post on social media about how much they love each other. We got a baby book of my niece last Christmas and I wasn‚Äôt even in it while my other sister got named ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs best aunt‚Äù. My father doesn‚Äôt stick up for me and my mom is not in any position to tell them off because things are already tense between them.

Because of this, I feel like a mistake. Like I‚Äôm a failed experiment or the B-version of a human. No matter what I do I will never garner any kind of success because my value is fundamentally lower than that of others.

1bke2o0,Tired of this,"I really dislike my life. So many reasons to discuss. Sadly I have to summarize it since my longer vent I wrote out disappeared when I switched apps for a moment. 

I'm ugly. I'm short for an adult male. I'm a poc and I deal with the negatives from it‚Äîthe expectations to be a certain way, the profiling, the stereotypes, the microaggressions, the uneasiness. My own people sometimes I feel like I can hardly relate to and they unironically do the most roasting/judging/mistreatment on average. I have social anxiety. At times I feel depressed. I am awkward. I am boring. I have a resting face. I have so much debt accruing it's not even funny. Jobs are extremely hard to get and these places just continue to ghost you and hit you with the same false closers ""we should get back to you on X/Y/Z day."" It's bad that I'm wasting my time going to these places just to hear a soft gust of wind in response. If I'm not a good fit or my availability doesn't work for you just let me know preferably as soon as you can, don't have me thinking if I will get it or not. Either that or they're a scam. Or in some of the obscure places they will pretend the job doesn't exist. One time I put on my formal attire and headed to a far town just for the staff to pretend like they had no idea what I'm talking about as I come in and inquire about the interview they set up. 

I don't have friends or relationship so I can't bug anyone with my struggles beside close family. I cannot relax out for fun anymore due to all the mistreatment and judgement I face for being ugly. I'm hardly taken seriously as a very short man. My resting face offends people and sometimes they will constantly ask are you ok when I am. It's tough to eat healthy like I want to. Healthy stuff is way too expensive. Hell, even junk food now is becoming more expensive. The debt is piling up and I'm getting so tired‚ÄîI now owe like 10 different places at once. My score is hitting rock bottom. 

Everything feels useless. My life feels repetitive and stagnant. I am extremely flawed. I can never ever shake the feeling that ""everyone hates me."" When I'm kind to others I even have some people using derogatory slang toward me for being so and insinuating that I'm weak. I have people getting offended that I keep to myself but it's like I've been pushed to be this way. There's too much else to write in this rant so I will have to continue later.

I was definitely not prepared for the side effects I got the second time around, sexual dysfunction being the most annoying of the bunch imo. Before going on SSRIs, I knew that they often came with a whole bunch of sexual side effects like lower libido/erectile dysfunction/inability to orgasm/vaginal dryness/lower sensitivity/etc. But I guess I should've known better than to just assume I'd have the same experience my 2nd time on antidepressants. Luckily, my libido is still somewhat high + I can still orgasm + my body still retains the same sensitivity, but I can barely get wet no matter what.

  
I naturally have a very high libido and getting wet used to be an extremely easy and almost instant thing whenever i got in the mood. Sex also means a lot to me since physical touch is one of my main love languages. My boyfriend (21M) is super sweet and understanding, but i'm honestly just really sad because it makes me feel hollow, like i'm missing a part of my body :(

  
I stopped tapered off the meds again \~3 weeks ago because of how much it bothered me, but nothing has changed. For anyone who's more knowledgeable on the subject and/or has experienced this before, did your sexual dysfunction symptoms go back to normal eventually? And how long did it take to see that progress?",Green_Particular_919,1,0,1711043462,depression

When i first statred medication, my sex drive was good, still could be aroused but have a bit problem with reaching to orgasm, but now while 3 years has passed, my sex drive has really decreased! I can't be aroused easily! Most of the things which used to turn me on feel so okay nowadays!

1bkcg2j,deep isolation ," I am experiencing feelings of deep isolation. 
It's hard to explain but I have had a number of small incidents at work that are very frustrating. Little things that are making me feel paranoid. I feel mistreated in that place, and I am feeling that I have to maintain constant silence because after all I know that whatever they did to me is my fault for being a bad person.  I'm a terrible person. Or an idiot.
I don't know really.
So, Today at home I tried to explain to my husband how I was feeling. He asked me what was wrong with me... it was a disaster. We ended up fighting... I mean, when I tried to explain to him he told me that he didn't know how to help me... things like all the time it's the same with you, there's nothing to be done, everyone has bad days, life was made to enjoy it... things like that...
I didn't get any peace from that conversation with my husband, nothing... it was worse, because now I feel like I'm a real nuisance to him and that I'm pushing him down, you know? 
I told him I'm going to ask my psychiatrist to put me on prozac and seroquel again... I hate those meds, they kill what little libido I have...  He told me that he doesn't want me to take that and such... which is a lie... he's probably desperate for me to shut my mouth and let him have some peace... I will ask for the medication because the problem is me... that I'm sick...

1bkc9wh,"I'm so tired. I'm 18, but I feel like I'm about 30 or more","Not sure if that's an exaggeration, but I'm so exhausted after all the hardships I've had to deal with.
I'm not gonna say every problem that I've had to solve, but it could be nice if anyone wouldn't make me feel bad that I just wanted a better life where I wasn't abused and traumatised. Plus I don't even know what to say because I was never allowed to express myself.

I had to move to a different country by myself because the people there were too homophobic and racist and aggressive The very same were my own family and old friends. I'm queer, I couldn't stand their racism and how unfair it was that they still abused me even tho I was just minding my own business. Once I moved out to a different country, I was homeless for like two months, then I got into an governmental accommodation for young homeless adults, but the people in that dorm are just drug addicts and convicts that are over 4 years older than me, and I have to share a dorm room with two of them. One of them is also from the country I left, and he's been bullying me just because I'm quiet, the same like the ones I had to deal with in highschool. Four months passed since I had to live with the morons and it's just terrifying because I never know when they'd just try to provoke me to a fight and they'd bully me. I told the managers of the accommodation, but they just gave the morons some warnings. I've tried to secure a job, but no luck since I'm just 18 and I don't have any experience. I just don't know how to manage to stay motivated anymore when it doesn't seem like anything will get better and I just have to endure more trauma. 

TL;DR: I've had a very traumatic time growing up. I moved to a different country by myself. It's not getting better and I don't know what to do.

1bkbshw,I want to give up and live an easy life.,"Hi all,   


For the past year and a half I have been able to live a comfortable life of just going to work as a dishwasher and coming home to play video games. Not investing much into myself, my hobbies or my past goals.  


Its been so easy and yet a part of me wants to just go dark on everything, not talk to anyone and just live this easy stable life like what many have done before me.  


I used to be so productive, doing so much but only making little money as what I am doing now.  
I am making 22 grand a year, more than what I have done working for jobs that I studied for and aimed for.  


Why is it so easy to look at this easy life and go ""Yep I want to give up"".  


The only thing holding me back from going dark is the fact that I live with someone who would crash down my door and ask me what is going on.   


Yet I still somehow want to self sabotage myself. I did this years ago with a really good job. And it has slowly affected my own interests.  


Kind regards,

Me

I've been struggling with depression for as long as I can remember, been in therapy since I was 11, yet I still can't function properly. I take 100mg zoloft a day but I'm not even sure if it's helping that much anymore, I might've reached a plateau.  

Lately things have gotten worse, it's not the first time that I'm unable to go outside or take care of myself, I'm so drained I can't even resort to my destructive coping mechanisms - but I've never hated myself this much. I can't stand to look at my body. When I stare in the mirror I see a stranger: a deformed, grotesque, pustulate, monstrous figure.  

I'm scared of being perceived, I don't want people to see me. I wish I didn't have a physical form. I don't know how to explain it, but it literally pains me to exist...I feel trapped and suffocated inside my cage made of skin.  

I got a bit over my self-esteem issues a couple of months ago and I started taking pictures and stuff for the first time, I was content with my looks, but I now spiral into comparing myself to other people, feeling inferior to them or being in denial to the point I can't even recognize who I am.  

Please do not try to comfort me with comments about my appearance because it only makes me more afraid of it.  

Do you also struggle with this? I know it's some kind of body dysmorphia, but I'm not sure what to do about it. Yes I've talked about it with my therapist and I haven't found a solution yet.

We started dating in September of last year and he has been the best person to come into my life. He is so thoughtful and so caring. He knows about all my mental issues and my family my/ home situation. And he doesn‚Äôt judge me for that. He loves me for me. 

I recently got my permit (I am an adult btw I just never knew how to drive please don‚Äôt judge me) and he‚Äôs been teaching me how to drive and I finally saved up enough money to buy a decent car and I‚Äôm so happy. I‚Äôve worked so hard to get this far and I‚Äôm glad he was apart of it. 

I really can‚Äôt wait to marry this man and have a family together I know it hasn‚Äôt been that long since we‚Äôve started dating, but we‚Äôve already talked about it and even his mom asked when will he propose haha. I‚Äôm looking forward to it. 

Now on to the shitty parts‚Ä¶Well I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 (damn fam you couldn‚Äôt let me inherit a mass fortune?) and I have depression on top of that too? Not to mention pmsing. I feel really bad for my boyfriend I‚Äôm glad he loves me even when I go a little bit crazy sometimes lol

I am currently on three medications and I‚Äôm just really tired of having to keep to a routine schedule of making sure I take them. I don‚Äôt really have an appetite anymore, like I‚Äôm hungry but every time I try to eat something I can‚Äôt finish it and I just want to go back to sleep. 

I feel really weak and tired. I haven‚Äôt been sleeping either ( my psychiatrist prescribed me an antipsychotic that‚Äôll put me to sleep, I‚Äôll give it a try.) sometimes I don‚Äôt even want to get up to pee and I‚Äôll just hold it until I can‚Äôt no more and then I‚Äôll get up to use the bathroom. 

I haven‚Äôt taken a bath in two weeks and I feel disgusted with myself and I told my boyfriend that and he tells me ‚ÄúBabe you‚Äôre not disgusting, I love you and I want to help you.‚Äù I think I‚Äôm about to start my period and this bitch is taking her time coming, so I‚Äôve been extremely moody and irritable.

Practically every night I‚Äôm on the phone with him crying uncontrollably (sometimes till I pass out like a baby lol) and he‚Äôs always there to comfort me and tell me it‚Äôs going to be alright. 

He is my light and one of my favorite person ever. He gives me a reason to wake up every day (even though sometimes it‚Äôs really hard to) because I look forward to us sharing a lifetime together and build a family together and strengthening our bond.

My wife and daughters recently went out of town to visit family and I was unable to go due to work. After just a couple days I came to a really grim realization. I have no friends. None, zero, nada. I went through my last three months of calls and it goes like this... Wife, wife, wife, wife, wife, wife, grandma, wife, wife, wife, wife, wife, work, wife, wife, wife, wife. 
Without my family, I have nobody. Everything I do I do completely alone or with my family. This never really bothered me before but I find myself envying people around me who are making plans, going to fun events and overall just loving life. My wife has friends. A whole community of other moms that she goes out with multiple times a week while I... Sit at home. I don't even know how to make friends!

Everything about life now is joyless.

Everything is too accessible, there is too much choice, too many opinions and not enough mystery

We know everything and nothing. Everything is a war. Everyone loves to tell everyone else how they should be or what they should do

Art (movies/songs) etc is hijacked by people with agendas. Those making the art, those watching the art. Everything is terrible to someone

Now its just an endless sludge of negativity. Constant and never ending. division politics is the name of the game and its only getting worse

I miss shopping for DVDs and CDs. I miss cash. I miss having to leave the house and travel to a library/Internet cafe to get online. 

Everything used to feel special, like an event

Now everything is just there, buzzing in my ears all day every day with no way to escape it 

I miss the days when places where RAMMED with people to the point I can't enjoy myself. Yes it used to be busy to a point but its totally unmanageable these days. Too many people, too many kids running around

I know nothing about life . There are many toxic traits in me that I am very scared of . When I go outside these scary traits shows itself. I also isolated myself.  I am very concious of myself.

I also obsessed with perfectionism due to which I think I did nothing.

My partner is unable to work due to their greencard expiring and this gives them no option to find a job. I know they try their best by streaming or cleaning or trying to cook and I greatly appreciate it but its still hard. I'm barely home, my bones hurt, and my mental health has all but vanished. All I get time to do at home is maybe eat and sleep. I don't find anything fun or enjoyable anymore and even a smile fades so quickly. My partner already knows the tremendous stress I'm in with student loans and paying the rent, let's just say I barely come out even if not a few hundred bucks under. 

Didn't get my dream job after college and now been working as a maintenance engineer trying to learn and build my career in a different way.  Been working for a good 3 years now still no promotion while I've seen someone newer and less experience get a promotion above me. I've even taken a few electrical and boiler classes in hopes to help more and hopefully build a better future for learning to get paid more and im usually just ignored. Its quite frustrating but as I always say it is what it is and I need these 2 jobs to pay to feed everyone. 

I'm just tired, some days I don't even remember driving home or to work. Don't even feel like eating much just somen ramen most night so i can afford bills.

But it feels like it isn't enough. My mom comes home everyday with an offhand remark about my existence. So far, she's brushed off every instance of me trying to express myself and change myself for the better. I went to college because of her, and I got a job because of the shame she makes me feel every single day.

Everyday, it feels like I'll never be loved. Not truly. No matter how hard I try I'll never be enough for anyone. Not my family, or my friends. My dad and my cat are the only things keeping me going, and even then, I know I'm letting him down too. I did all I could on my own (they were never really there for me emotionally) but I'm so tired. I'm tired every day and I can't stand living some days.

I can't stand knowing the mistakes I've made and I can't stand not being enough even tho I tried so hard to pick myself up after all the emotional abuse I've endured. It feels like it was all for nothing everytime I wake up in the morning.

Nearly all of my problems comes from my father, here in fast what he teached me over the years:

If you cant do it then dont it

Emotions are Bad all of them

Hobbys are only ok to do if the father does not need to do anything or give you money

Dont do it with force (I never did anything with force but when he saw me for example trying Insert a usb Stick he would loudly talk dont to it with force!)

You do what I say nothing more nothing less I felt like a robot put away If you doont need him....

I grew up in a 56square meters flat, he did not want somthing bigger, becaus then he would getting help from Germany I have 3siblings +mom/dad so 6 people means no privacy. He bought PC and consols early on, so he had an ez way to keep us silent, I was playing the first battlefield back then I was 6 years old. My mother were never really with us, she work all the time the only sorce of income and was most the time to tired to do activities.

With 18 I became depressed and quickly make my first trip to a clinc and a second one, the third one was becaus of an suicide attempt, at the fourth I got an new diagnosis Obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder becaus of my home live, the 5 one is till now my last one. I cant get therapy without clinics, because I am always so extremely tired that I miss most of my appointments. My tiredness is basically my whole personality I sleep in average 11-13 hours with hughe variety, i slept on time over 24h without any medication. If I am awake I play video games, I have hughe problems trying to learn a new skill, becaus of how much I learned if I cant do it I should not do it.

I basically wait untill holidays so I can meet my brothers, wich I have a good connection with, but outside of that they don't have much free time. Despite we lived under the same roof I am the only one who completely broke (I am the youngest) the rest have jobs one nearly finished his studies, although the one who study has depression. I would love nothing more then do have regular work life, for the money, for some sozial interactions for my self-esteem.

I just don't know why I am alive or what to do with it, I only would wish for a bit more money so I could get a new PC and to support my brothers otherwise I don't have any goals or wishes in live.

1bjzww0,It's too late for me,"I'll start this off by saying, no im not suicidal. So I apologize because I know the title gives off that vibe. I'm more so just needing to vent. 

I married my high-school girlfriend, and we were together for 10 years. I gave her the world, worked my ass off to the bone, so she could pretty much have and do whatever she wanted. She never knew financial struggle. However, what we built for 10 years, took her 10mins to completely destroy when she cheated on me. And it fucking BROKE me. Took me a long time to heal from that. 

Now here I am, about a year and a half later, and been trying get back out there, but I'm worried it's too late for me. I'm almost 30, outta shape, and would be generous in saying I'm a 5 outta 10. I fear I won't meet that special someone again. Hell, I don't even know how to talk to women. I get to shy and awkward. Due to my looks, I probably come off as creepy. 

The worst part, I'll never have a family of my own. Ever since I was a kid, I always wanted that sitcom life, ya know? A wife and a couple kids. But I feel that ship as sailed for me. Guess I just gotta get use to it. 

I've tried all the dating apps, and it's always the same story. I'll swipe right on 1000 girls, and the only time I get a match, is when it's either some bot, scam account, or some chick promotion her OF.  

It's really fucking with me mentally. All my friends have their families now, and here I am. The dude that was blinded by love and didn't see the snake, and it's too late for me to recover and have the life I always wanted. ",AvengedClayFoldX95,1,0,1711002014,depression

1bjzni5,I don't even know if it's depression,"Every day I wake up and the world feels dull. Like one of my senses is missing, or a color has been removed from my palette. It feels like I'm following in footsteps that were carved by a beast millions of years ago, and I've been told to follow the trail even though it's been buried under the soil for a millenia. I suppose it's hopelessness, the feeling that things won't get better and that no matter what I do there will always be a hole in my sinking ship, but I don't even know if it's that.

My own thoughts differ from my actions so much I'm starting to get confused on who I really am. When I talk to my therapist or family, I'm self-aware and self-hating yet willing to make a difference. When I talk to strangers I'm outgoing and funny. When I talk to friends I'm loud and entertaining. When I'm alone, I'm just a piece of the wall. I fill in the spaces left by others and exist there until another hole opens, and I move to that one.

I went to college because I was told I need to to get a good job. I was told I need a good job so I can make money. I was told I need to make money in order to live. And I'm told I need to live because those around me will miss me if I don't live. I'm tired of being told this same order of events. I'm tired of being told what to do, yet when I'm not told what to do I don't know what to do. So I don't do anything.

I started college and by the second semester I was barely going to classes. They just don't feel challenging. They always were interesting when I went, but they felt ultimately pointless. It's all things I've either heard before or just simply felt unimportant. I tried multiple subjects, tried multiple classes, but every time I would just sit in the back of the room, under stimulated and barely conscious of the world around me. 

And then there's the assignments. So mind-numbingly boring that I wanted to slit my throat with ever written word, with every corrected comma. For fucks sake after hearing about APA style for the 30th time, you start to stop giving a fuck about it and just write however the fuck you want, because that bitch who just assigned 14 pages on a dude who died old and racist because ""he had such a huge impact on the world."" I DONT GIVE A FUCK. Stop telling me what I have to know. Why can't I figure out what I need? Why do I have to be told that this is what's known, this is what's necessary, this is what you need this is what we need, this is how you do this. FUCK OFF. 

That's not really the problem. I'm just tired. Anyways, on the rare time I managed to sit through the assignment and finish it, it was a coins flip if I'd actually even remember to turn the damn thing in, because ADHD decided that my brain will develop at about half the pace of the average human, so hey I may be 20 but I have the mental and emotional fortitude of a 15 year old, anyways time to pick out what I want to do for the rest of my life!

1bjziy6,Please ignore. Desperate for attention.,"Why do you hurt yourself?

Because I believe I should.

Why do you wander?

Because I have nothing else to do.

Seeing pictures of other people. Walking down the street and looking at the faces of strangers.
 It lights the coals of my burning self hatred. To see someone be so beautiful. And me so detestable.
 I thinks it‚Äôs part of the reason I‚Äôm more interested and more attracted to people who look Imperfect. Especially when they have more weight on them. 

When I see someone truly beautiful my brain immediately tells me to basically ignore them out of fear. My brain puts the dots together for me and tells me I‚Äôm sewage compared to them and thus am unworthy of speaking to them and that it‚Äôs impossible that a connection could be made. Despite this my mind zooms in on them when I first see them. I imagine a thousand possibilities. I imagine different freak scenarios which I‚Äôve only heard of through word of mouth and movies. Then they leave my sight forever. And I come to the old immovable truth. That it will always be a fairytale. Images of gripping bed sheets and laughing watching movies are extinguished by her back walking away. I don‚Äôt know her. And I never will. 

The same girl walks into my sight. Only she‚Äôs about 30 or 50 pounds heavier. I‚Äôm more attracted to her. Why? Because my brain believes that the chances of her finding me attractive and actually being with her are higher. I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm beautiful. I feel ugly, like a beaten pig. Therefore I can‚Äôt believe that others will and that they will accept me. So when I find someone who I think could share the same problems based on quick and rude judgements I find it more believable they‚Äôll accept me. Because truth be told I‚Äôll accept anyone. And I hate that. I hate that I‚Äôm that shallow. That I‚Äôm that pathetic and disrespectful about people and woman. My mind sees many woman as saviours. As objects for my pleasure. Not just physically but mentally too.

 The toxic waste leaks out of my ears. I have a lot of issues. And I‚Äôm scared of loving someone because of that. I‚Äôm scared of hurting someone. I‚Äôm scared of being hurt. I‚Äôm scared of shame.  I‚Äôm scared of not being enough. I want to be held and told its alright and I‚Äôm perfect and that I don‚Äôt have to be anything else then what I am. In the fetal position being held by someone safe. Shushing my cries and whimpers. The saviour complex. An excuse for weaklings like me to ignore their problems. 
There‚Äôs this thought that keeps popping up in my head. That if I was American. I‚Äôd probably be dead. I would have gone into mams closet and unlocked the gun safe. Then I would have shot myself in the head. So easy. Too easy. I‚Äôm scared of that thought yet I want it so bad in my darkest times. Just pick something up and point and click. So quick you can‚Äôt change your mind. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm grateful I‚Äôm European or spiteful because I‚Äôm not. That eternal sleep. The infinite blackness which consumes me like a warm bath. It calls to me. But for now I must tell it to wait.

1bjzgob,little rant,"It‚Äôs not horrible to the point of where I can‚Äôt do important things, so maybe it‚Äôs not that bad. It could be so much worse and I feel bad for thinking that I need more help with this? More help than I can give myself? 

Overall, I‚Äôm fine. I think I just feel worse at times when I should probably feel just the usual amount of sadness? It‚Äôs like I spiral, or recently, I‚Äôve noticed that there‚Äôs this new feeling. 

I feel this panic or dread? It‚Äôs like a new low. Like, I have felt low before but it‚Äôs now going even lower. Like I‚Äôve unlocked a new part of my depression? I don‚Äôt want to end my life, but during that low my mind sometimes goes to that? ‚ÄúWhat if..‚Äù y‚Äôknow? I know I shouldn‚Äôt and I never will because I am terrified of doing something like that but sometimes it just, I dunno. It‚Äôs there, and I hate that it‚Äôs there. 

I don‚Äôt know if writing this will really help? I wish I could just stop feeling this way because I‚Äôm really sick of it. I‚Äôm thinking about finding a new therapist? She‚Äôs helpful sorta? I honestly feel like it‚Äôs my own fault. I don‚Äôt have any long term goals with my mental health? And each session, she asks me what‚Äôs the goal of the session, and I really don‚Äôt know. I usually end up talking about something like my social anxiety (I manage it pretty well already, I just sometimes forget about my tools), or something else that‚Äôs brief? She helps though! But I feel like I keep going back to the same issues? 

Anyways, I still feel this panic and dread? I‚Äôve cried, texted a friend, did some deep breathing, and even drew something but I still feel it. It‚Äôs sitting on my chest and for some reason I can feel it I my stomach as well. I hate this and honestly I don‚Äôt know if this is depressions doing? Maybe this is an anxiety thing?

i‚Äôve had perfect grades all my life. honors classes and even an AP. i just had to ruin it all. i ended the first quarter with such high grades, i was so proud of myself, for once. then all went downhill. long story short, i physically and mentally could not do any schoolwork. my averages became 60s and even a 20. i was barely in school, and when i was, i was skipping classes and exams. i skipped more exams during finals week than i took. 

now for the past two months i‚Äôve been rotting away in my bed. i still haven‚Äôt touched any schoolwork. the school and parents and working on letting me do some kind of online schooling. i feel so useless. i started to harm myself. the meds help to an extent, but i absolutely hate taking them. i only take them when i‚Äôm forced by my parents, and i only take half the dose. two classmates have texted where and how i‚Äôve been but i don‚Äôt have the guts to reply.

what have i done to myself? to my academic career? i‚Äôll probably have to retake freshman year. i was doing so well. now i just sit at home and rot. literally rot. i have to be reminded to take showers, it‚Äôs so hard to brush my teeth. i don‚Äôt brush my hair for weeks and then cry whilst unknotting the matted nest it becomes. i hate myself. i was my moms shining star. i know she must be so embarrassed of me now, i know i am. my sister is now the shining star, and she looks at me and my matted hair and my trashed room and my dirty unchanged clothes and my ugly miserable face in disgust. she‚Äôs told my parents she‚Äôs afraid of becoming like me.

It's been a difficult time, and I'm not sure how to cope with everything on my own.

Since the pandemic started, I've been feeling isolated and lonely, spending most of my time at home. This has led to feelings of boredom and disconnection, especially since I've been studying from home due to the lockdown. Despite graduating from grade 8 and starting half of grade 9 at home through modular learning, I've been feeling increasingly anxious and depressed. I've noticed changes in my behavior, such as becoming more withdrawn, nervous, and experiencing racing thoughts, especially when interacting with others.

Additionally, I've been struggling with perfectionism, which is a new experience for me. I used to be more outgoing and talkative, but now I find myself feeling shy and anxious in social situations. I've also noticed that I've become more self-critical and prone to stammering when speaking. These changes in behavior have made me question whether something is wrong with me.

Moreover, I've been experiencing intrusive thoughts and paranoia. I often find myself worrying excessively about being watched or judged by others, to the point where I take precautions like covering myself with a towel in the bathroom or feeling the need to express defiance towards potential surveillance. These thoughts and behaviors have been distressing and consuming, leading me to question my sanity and safety.

I'm really hoping to get some help with all of this. I want to feel better and learn how to manage my symptoms and challenges in a healthy way.


If anyone has been through similar experiences or has suggestions for coping strategies or resources that could help me, I would greatly appreciate it. Can you provide guidance on what steps I can take to start feeling better and managing my mental health effectively on my own?

1bjxli2,"I have been depressed for so long, I feel like there is no hope","It's hard for me to put what I feel into words, so anything I write here might not truly reflect what I am feeling inside. My depression began long ago but different factors along the course of my life have either helped me get better or get worse. It began with school bullying as far back as elementary school, now I am a 27 year old who doesn't even remember what ""mental stability"" feels like. I could go on and on about my mental break downs in school or earlier in my life, but I feel like those don't matter anymore, maybe they do, but it's not what's on my mind right now. What's on my mind is that my life is just pure BS. I have this goal set for myself, but no matter how much I try to reach for it, I feel like it just gets farther and farther. Me and my gf both have the same goals, but she's closer to it than I am, but I feel like my approach to fulfill my goal is only drifting us apart. She comes from a wealthier family than I do, so for most of my relationship I have had to do more work, I am working 2 jobs as well as finishing up my university studies which has driven me insane, I get less than 5 hours of sleep daily, I barely have a social life at all, I can't remember what fun feels like, plus my job, despite being a job I like, has become so draining and hard that I am second guessing my career choice. This is actually my second career choice, I pursued my first one and realized I didn't like it at all, so I went in debt to pay off a study I didn't like and therefore spent 5 years of paying off student loans for nothing (I do not live in USA so University is cheaper here). I have become insanely forgetful, so much so that it is affecting my jobs, relationship and daily life in general, which only adds to my depression, self-hate, and personal image of myself. I try to calm myself by eating, I've even picked up smoking again (something I had stopped doing a few years ago), indulge in heavy caffeine drinking such as multiple cups of coffee and tea. I'm sorry, I know I am not helping myself with this, but I feel it's what brings me momentary relief, I sleep late because of work and university as well as I try to do something I like with the little time I have like watch a movie or play some video games, it helps calm myself, but by doing this I end up sacrificing time I could spend sleeping and therefore only get a few hours of sleep. I know my post is poorly organized, I am bad at wording things out. I can't afford a therapist right now, nor do I have much time either, as I am typing this I should be sleeping since I have to go to work in about 6 hours as of typing this and I am so sad to say that I am not looking forward to it. I could quit my job, but then I would be even farther away from my goal than ever before.

I can burn myself with no questions, bruises have many excuses, and depriving myself of food and water is unnoticeable since I'm skinny and rarely drink water. 




This pain is different though. My heart squeezes and is pulled into my stomach when it happens. It's a pang that strikes through my body. The pang is a mixture of disgusting and hate for my sole existence. And it hurts. My heart squeezing when I'm hit with these pangs reminds me of when I 'overdosed' on caffeine and nearly gave myself a heart attack. It hurts so badly. My body is punishing me for being a worthless wretch.

It's long so you can just skim it. 

""I don't really know how I feel rn. I don't to want to die, but fading into nothing sounds pretty nice. I don't want to sleep, I just don't want to exist. I want to go lay down in the grass and leave my body to the ants. I don't feel like living, but I don't want to die.

I don't want it to. I can't keep doing this. I don't know if I can keep going. this is really sounding really not good. I think i might need help. I don't feel like a burden to those around me. I just don't think they would care if I was gone. I feel like I take up to much space. I think I should just disappear. I want to go outside. it's dark. I just need to feel something real under my feet. my window looks very jump outable. I have a song stuck in my brain. it's from a romance show. I need human connection. I don't have any. no close friends no close family no partner. I see people falling in love on TV and telling each other things. I can't do that. I have too many walls. nobody can know me. I feel alone. unmissable. but no suicide for me haha. I'm not that crazy. I'm just writing about how much I wish I was gone on a Tuesday at 9pm. I'm not crazy. I've thought about self harm, it doesn't appeal to me. I don't get it. pain makes me feel something. I feel like nothing. nothing is nice. nobody cares about nothing. people care about something. something can't stay in bed all day. something has to shower and do stuff. I don't want to be something. I want to be nothing. fade away into black. feel the earth swallow me whole. at least then I'll be held. I feel cold. the draft in my room moving the hairs on my arm. the black doesn't look cold. it looks warm, like a bed. not one with a million pillows to throw off. one that has just one big soft thick blanket you can lose yourself under. I want to be smothered by that blanket. I think I'm done here, but I don't feel done. I just want to feel like a whole, or to be nothing. ones easier than the other. maybe nothing is the better option. nothing is waiting for me. I can be myself with nothing. because I am nothing. worthless. and I'll always be that way. if I go to therapy and get healthy I'll still be me. I'll always be me. completely useless, inside and out. if I'm going to be useless I might as well be nothing. at least then I won't be the random piece of broken plastic in someones junk drawer. if I had to call myself an object it'd be that. nothing to be desired, just there. just something that's not even worth the time to throw it out. just sitting stuck forever. and that's the end of it. curtains closed. when I will lay on my death bed, I will be the same as I am now, so why wait.""",sugar_free_spinach,2,2,1710988249,depression

1bjukjh,Bullying = depression,"Hey everyone I just wanted to share my bullying story and how it sometimes still affects me to this day. I will start off with my personality in school, I was very shy and quiet, which instantly made me a target. Basically in year 8 I was hanging around with this group of boys and girls, a lot of them would date each other and then I was left on the outskirts, constantly being excluded. They would constantly ask me questions like why are you so quiet in a mocking tone, which used to infuriate me. I used to walk around school on my own and leave school crying because I felt so isolated. I was also dealing with my sexuality back then so i felt further isolated. These group of girls which I considered my friends actually assaulted me once, by nearly blinding me, and because I was so embarrassed I did not tell anyone at the time. I fell into depression at the time.

They would make fun of the way I talked, walked, and used to cyber bully me too by calling me mocking nicknames, e.g. my contact name saved in their phone. At one point I was actually scared to go to school, because they would spam my phone with horrible messages. In Year 11 I got a new set of friends and they used to lock those friends in classrooms, and my school, the toxic hell that it was, never did anything about it. Anyway, I graduated high school, got a 2:1 in my degree and I am doing well sporting wise. I was so filled with anger at the time, and honestly I wish them all the worst in their lives. That feeling of exclusion and being ostracized, I can still feel to this day. It makes it hard for me to trust people. However, to everyone currently being bullied, just remember that revenge is the best success. They won‚Äôt be able to stand how they treated you back then.

1bju6d7,I‚Äôm pissed I don‚Äôt have noticeable scars ,"Rant
So I started self harming back in December. I started with burning my feet, I quickly realized I enjoyed not just the pain but the after effects too. I liked having my feet bandaged, not because it was comfortable or got me attention or anything, but I think the little tingles of pain I got throughout the day. I also liked seeing the scars once it was healed, I‚Äôm not sure why. I soon switch to cutting my arms, not deep as I don‚Äôt want to cause permanent damage, but I do have some faint scars. At first I liked the scars, but the more I look at them and the more they fade away, the more I feel like shit, like I can‚Äôt even cut myself right especially since I can‚Äôt get it to bleed. This got a little worse when I went to the hospital (completely unrelated) and none of the doctors, nurses or even my family noticed anything wrong with my arm! Again not that I want them to see the scares. But am I really that bad at everything that I can‚Äôt even cut myself correctly? 

Today I had to do it again, and got PISSED because cutting no longer felt right. I made one very small cut before I got so mad I had to stop. I didn‚Äôt want to go back to burning, so I tried some alternative my therapist told me about, first I held ice cubes to my arm ( the one I cut) I hated it because the water running down my arm made me think of the blood I WANT to see but can‚Äôt! The burn after felt kinda good tho. 
The second one I tried was putting a hair tie on my wrist, pulling it taught and releasing it so it hits my wrist. I did this over and over again till my arm was sore and red. It felt good and made me feel better but‚Ä¶ 
There was no blood, no scars , no cuts NOTHING ! Just red skin for a few minutes

1bjtlci,I have to restart my entire 2nd year of uni and I haven't told my parents,"Basically, I (M20) had a mental breakdown this year which has caused me to miss almost all of my lectures and deadlines this past term. I've been struggling with my mental health since I was 10, and this isn't the first time something like this has happened to me. During lockdown I was in my Junior year of high school was the worst--from February to spring break I couldn't do any homework and starting doing poorly on tests because of it. It wasn't that the work was too difficult or that I didn't like it; I've always loved school and learning, but I would procrastinate so badly that I missed deadlines, and I would get so anxious staring at the blank computer screen that I would have panic attacks. I started self-harming to try and force myself to do my work, but that obviously didn't help. Eventually, I told my parents what had been happening and they were very understanding. They created a plan with me, and I was shockingly able to finish all of my late work, and with partial credit I actually managed to get all my A's back.

Despite my repeated troubles I had pretty good grades overall, and I was able to get into a good university in London, which I was quite happy about since UK undergrad degrees tend to be 3 years instead of 4, and I wanted to get to grad school as quickly as possible so I could eventually be a professor. Also, despite the higher rates for international tuition, it was still less expensive than instate tuition at my second choice. My parents decided to use most of our saved funds for college for me, mostly because my older sister had been able to pay for her own tuition by going to community college and working while living at home. My younger sister still has quite some time before she gets to college, and my dad started making a lot more money a few years back, so they'll probably have enough money for her depending on where she wants to go. Still, they did use a lot of money for me, about 30k per year and they also helped with housing significantly (London rent isn't cheap!)

There were some delays in getting my visa, which forced me to fly to London alone (first time away from North America!) and I was terrified. Well, I wasn't scared until the plane landed, since then I realized it was a lot more difficult to figure out a foreign transportation system than I had anticipated. That year was very difficult for me. I was too scared to leave my room most of the time, and it took me a very long time to befriend my flat-mates. I was just so scared of everything and everyone, in a way that I never had experienced before. Still, I was doing fine academically, and I eventually got involved in societies and made some friends. However, I still had bouts of depression, and often got assignments started the day they were due. At the end of the year, I actually missed an assignment because of this, and I had to retake it over the summer for the minimum possible marks. If you aren't familiar with the UK education system, at uni you usually only have a handful assignments or exams per course, and little to no homework or formative work. It should have been easy compared to the workloads I was used to, but for some reason it was so much harder when I had so little to do.

I thought this year would be better; it would be a fresh start; I already had friends and I was much more confident than my first year. However, I still had issues getting to class and doing my work. Especially nearing the end of term 1 I missed several lectures and I was beginning to freak out. When I got back for term 2 I fell hard into depression within a week, being unable to leave my flat for days, even for food. Most of my term 1 deadlines were in January and I missed all of them. I missed the vast majority of my term 2 lectures and I became quite suicidal. The whole time, however, I tried to keep up with society responsibilities, as I knew if I didn't have friends around I wouldn't last. This just made me feel like a hypocrite--if I can do so much work for other people, why can't I show up to class? But at that point it felt impossible, I was so scared of going after having missed so much. Worst of all, I ended up ghosting my best friend from the US because I was too anxious to respond to a serious message he sent me in January. I responded to him a few days ago apologizing and explaining where I'd been, but he still hasn't answered. I think I may have ended that friendship permanently because of my stupid fucking anxiety.

I convinced myself I would watch the lecture recordings and do my assignments and answer my texts and phone calls, but everything kept slipping past me, and I felt helpless. I even tried self-harming again, which--surprise, surprise--didn't work again. I eventually reached out for help when my department sent me an email asking where I've been. Now they're telling me I'm likely going to have to take an interruption of studies. I'll have to redo all of my term 1 assignments and retake all of my term 2 courses next year. I'll be a year behind my peers, my friends, and my plans for myself. I'll have to pay half a year of extra tuition. I'll have to reapply for my visa, and I might have to leave the UK until January, even though my lease doesn't end until September. I auditioned for a musical that's being put on by my friend's production company in London over the summer. I had plans to reach out to my professors to be a research assistant this summer as well. I'll have to let down my friends, and I've already let down my family.

Now I have to tell them what happened before I fly back to the US for Easter break. They were understanding when I was in high school, but I'm an adult now. I chose to go to school in a different country. I chose not to reach out for help when I knew I needed it. I went to therapy for the first time over the summer, but I ghosted my therapist when they reached out for online sessions in the fall. I ran out of my new meds, but I felt like they didn't work so I never got a refill. What makes me feel worse about this all is that my younger sister had to go to inpatient over the fall due to her mental health issues, and she's had to spend the second half of 8th grade being homeschooled. She really looks up to me, and I don't want her to see me like this. She has her own problems, and my parents should only have to worry about her. It's a lot on all of their plates, and now I'm going to add to it significantly. How do I tell my friends, my family, my judgmental extended family, that I'm gonna take a year longer than I said I would? Would I even survive in grad school if I can't handle undergrad? Not to mention attempting a career in academia--it just seems like a foolish pipe-dream now.

I'm so scared of telling everyone, I just wish I could start the year over without actually starting over. I wish I didn't have depression so I could just get out of bed when I feel bad. I wish things could just be easy. I am feeling better now, from a mental health perspective, but the shame is still enormous and inescapable. Sorry this post was so long, I've just had a lot on my mind for months now and I haven't been able to share it with anyone. I made a reddit account specifically for this, lol.

TL;DR - I skipped all my lectures and missed my deadlines due to depression so now I have to retake my classes, delaying my graduation by a year, and now I have to tell my family I failed.",raskolite,3,1,1710981754,depression

1bjs6tb,"Very tired, but fighting every day","Hi there. Made this account 5 minutes ago. I'm a 28 year old male from the US. I've seen some of the posts on this subreddit used as a way of just getting users' thoughts out into the world, and that's what I want to do because I can't afford therapy lol. 

I've never been diagnosed with depression, or anything as much as the occasional strep throat. I have struggled with negative feelings though, about myself mostly, but also about the people around me. My home life growing up wasn't a happy one. My siblings and I suffered a lot of psychological abuse from my dad for a long time. We would get yelled at, interrogated, insulted, etc. over the smallest things, often to the point of tears. When my brother or I cried, our dad would feminize our names (e.g. a name like Joseph would become Josephine.) 

I bring this up because I coped badly with my home life for a long time. I learned that the best way to avoid punishment was to avoid my family altogether as much as possible. I would go outside or hide in my room whenever my dad was home. I would still do dumb kid/teenager shit, but I got really good at keeping it from my parents. There was never really a time I felt that I could ask for advice or ask for help. I developed a kind of independence that I was proud of for a long time, even though I fucked up a lot, and I had to learn a lot of things the hard way. In my mind, relying on someone gave them the power to hurt me, so if I couldn't get it myself, I didn't want it. I actually refused to accept tuition money from my dad because I felt like taking the money would be giving him power over me.

Over time, that pride in my independence started to falter, and it started to feel less like a choice and more like I wasn't actually capable of being open or vulnerable with anyone. When I screwed anything up, no matter how small, I'd rip into myself relentlessly. I couldn't bring myself to start a relationship. I only pursued casual sex with co workers or women I met out with friends. Even my friendships started to feel fake, like everyone close to me was an acquaintance. I carried a lot of hurt, and I felt that I had to carry it alone or risk alienating myself. I felt alone and defeated, often hopeless. Being happy or lovable felt like a pipe dream. Much of this still applies today, though I'm in a better place than I was in a few years ago. 

As of now, I'm in a weird transition phase. I realize that I need to be more open with people close to me, but it's very difficult. I don't want to be seen as weak or incapable, and I dont want to change the nature of my current relationships. Being 28 also, it feels as though I should have this figured out by now. On the bright side, I can accept now that I'll fuck up, and I have to forgive myself and keep moving forward. I want to be a better person and I want people to know me, even if it means letting them know where my weaknesses are.

It's mentally exhausting sometimes, but I'm taking it a day at a time now, and I'm learning how to be patient with myself. I'm pursuing a relationship now with the mindset that I deserve to love and be loved, without bringing any baggage from my past into it. I've also been hitting those weights baby! üí™ It's cliche, but I cant tell you how helpful that's been. 

I never talk about these things to anyone, so if you read this whole thing, I appreciate you. This was mainly just to say something I've never been able to say before, and even finishing this off, I feel relieved just to have put it out there.

I got bullied by teachers and my peers because of how behind I was academically and just because of how ‚Äúslow‚Äù I was. Even still,  I got passed and went through each grade barely scraping by. I Knew something was wrong and desperately wanted help, but my parents refused to accept I was dumb so today I suffer with critical thinking, learning, articulation, comprehension, you name it, if it‚Äôs academic or involves using my brain I struggle. I can barely hold conversations, and half of the time I‚Äôm confused in them because I can‚Äôt keep up with what‚Äôs being said.

My wife knew as much or suspected as much, but I really didn‚Äôt realize it until nearly a year ago to the day.

I faced with an exciting long weekend trip planned. It was supposed to be exciting at least. The day of I became extremely scared and anxious. I felt like almost at once I lost interest in the event I had been looking forward to all year long. I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed and I started crying.

It was at that point I finally understood what people who described depression meant. It finally hit me. I scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist, got sober, and started to really focus on my wellbeing.

A year later and I feel like I can feel the anxiety creeping up. I hate it. I hate focusing more on missing my wife, dogs, home, etc and not on the fun long weekend plans I have. My wife tells me I should be telling my psychiatrist I need something for immediate relief like Xanax but I‚Äôm pretty sure I can‚Äôt just demand that of my doctor. I also can‚Äôt help but feel like even though that kind of thing might get me over the hump that it‚Äôs just a bandaid for a bigger problem.

So I just wanted to vent about this. The onus for me really taking this seriously was the fact I missed the same event this time last year and I was devastated I sabotaged myself by not taking care of myself. I feel like things are going much better but despite that I can feel my fears creeping up. Maybe that‚Äôs just a part of getting older or something else entirely. I‚Äôd just like to think that a year of Prozac and Wellbutrin would help me to be happier and not focus so much on my anxieties.",metal_spellcaster,3,1,1710974083,depression

1bjom31,"Everywhere I go, I feel alone.","TW mentions if alcohol and brief mentions of self harm.

I have suffered from depression and pretty high anxiety (not gonna pretend it's the worst but I have sometimes month long periods where I can't bring myself to go outside because people make me so anxious) since I was 12, I'm now almost 18. 

August of last year I had decided to kill myself, and I had that same thought I'm sure all of you have had, that if I do this I can't turn back. So I decided to give life one last chance and take no bullshit from anyone including myself (that's a different story but none of this has happened and I'm far more miserable than I was before, college is insanely stressful, my hair has been falling out, and I think I scratch my head in my sleep since I regularly wake up with my pillow covered in blood which is new for me). I moved across the country and started studying animal behaviour. I am generally a very polite person, I care deeply about people around me, and I would jump in front of a bus to save a stranger, yet it seems nobody around me cares how caring or insightful or interesting of a person I can be? Every friend I have made constantly treats me as an after thought, I've never once in my life been invited to do something outside of school with anyone, or really in school. It's not like I'm not talkative either, and I would say I'm pretty funny, but since every friend I've had in my life has ditched me, or screwed me over, or shit talked me behind my back. I can count on one hand the number of people that have stayed around through my anxiety and depressive attacks, and due to their circumstances they aren't around much. I've noticed I've started to become spiteful, which I think is fair enough. Every time I look around and see people laughing with their friends I get so upset, why do those people deserve to be happy but I deserve to live in constant misery by myself??? And sometimes I think quite violently because of this and that's pretty upsetting to me. Obviously I would never act on any of this, and I would rather self sacrifice even for people who don't give a fuck about me, but it hurts so much to do that and it's such a lonely existence and I just don't understand what keeps leading me to this situation. Why am I always an afterthought? 

The first time I seriously hurt myself, I had been planning my birthday for months with my friends at the time, we were gonna go camping, get drunk and smoke, listen to music, watch films and all the usual stuff. They all cancelled on me the literally day of the event, I had already packed my things to go. I broke into our alcohol cupboard and drank 2 bottles of vodka and watched a Michael Myers movie alone at 4 AM. I started thinking and I seriously couldn't handle being alive and I slammed my head into my wall over and over until my tears and a small patch of blood stained it.

Why can't I just be one of those people at the bar right now, not a thought in their head, dancing, having drinks and laughing with their friends. It just feels so unfair, why can't I be born as someone else?

I feel infinitely more alone in a crowded room than an empty one since at least the silence doesn't bite. 

Thanks for listening to my rant :)

1bjokkv,I don‚Äôt have any reason to be sad but yet I am.,"I have depression but I have no valid reason to feel this way. 

The worst things thats ever happened to me as a kid was being teased and made fun of, beat up a couple times, never had a lot of friends.
I don‚Äôt feel any of this is a valid reason to act the way I do.

I first started getting anxious around people at 2 years old, this is when my two dogs passed away and I was alone for the first time in life.I got very shy and cried every day in my moms arms before getting hand over to the kindergarten teachers.
In kindergarten I had 2 friends which later changed to only one. I would get beat up by two brothers. One was a year older and one was a year younger than me. 
It wasn‚Äôt horrible. My parents never even noticed.

When I started school I would still cry in the morning, no longer every day but still often. When I reached 3rd grade I started resisting to go to school.
My mom would drag me to the car by the collar of my jacket cause I was staying home one or two days a week and she was fed up.

By the 4th grade I lost all my friends. My teachers thought it would be good to put me in a different class where I didn‚Äôt have the only people I weren‚Äôt scared to talk to.
Now that im thinking back it would probably not have been so hard to make friends, at an age like that it‚Äôs easy, but at the time I couldn‚Äôt. 
I kept staying home a lot.

From the 4th-6th I started getting teased for my hair and clothes. I had everything from red and black split dye to purple hair with white stripes. My clothes were always 3 Sizes too big, I would rather be teased for my clothes than my body.

I always hated the way I looked, Even before people started calling me ugly. My skin was to dark, my legs were to skinny, my stomach was to big, I didn‚Äôt like how I didn‚Äôt have breast. I planned how I could cut off my fat with minimal scarring
I was only 4.

It only got worse as I got older. Now I was thinking about every tiny feature. But this is also not enough to be depressed.
Everyone is insecure

In 6th-7th grade I was picked on for how I looked. From peers, strangers, relatives, even friends. 
But it wasn‚Äôt awful. Not like the stories I can see on the internet. My life is easy, so why am i like this.

8th grade. I couldn‚Äôt leave the house without insane nausea from anexiety. I went to school for 2 days before I broke down in the bathroom. I never went after that, Im starting collage and I haven‚Äôt even gone to school
one
single
day.

I am throwing away my ‚Äúbest‚Äù years because im ‚Äúdepressed‚Äù when I have no reason to be. I never attempted or anything like that. Never wanted to either. I don‚Äôt want to live this way, But I want to live.

Sometimes I wish my childhood was worse. Maybe that my parents were divorced, or that they neglected me instead of being helicopter parents. Not to feel pain, not cause I want it or think it‚Äôs cool, I just wish I had an actual excuse to spend all day in bed and feel like shit.

I must admit, I'm not so great at this life malarkey. Feel like I'm not 100% living most of the time, not that that makes any sense but it's difficult to put into words. 

So, I didn't have the best of upbringing. Parents separated when I was 10 in an incredibly unpleasant way. Quickly after that my Mom was in a relationship with now my step-father. I heard lots about my Mom and Father's breakup through the mouth of my step-father about what my father used to do to my mother, so on and so fourth.  I'm not going to go into detail as it still enrages me to this day, still very raw deep down - I believe this is where my troubles started. 
A year or 2 after that - probably much less but what felt like an eternity I started taking severe punishments for things I don't remember from my step-father. Beatings, a broken bone here and there, bruises, stopped from being outside with my friends. Until a relative saved me and pretty much saved my life. (In my eyes). 
I have alot of great memories from living with my relative. In fact, I dont remember a bad memory. But one thing I did miss out on was growing up with and being around my siblings. I did fear for them even at such a young age. Things from the past started troubling me at high school, getting me into trouble and even kicked out of school - but I couldn't speak. I couldn't open up to a single soul. I've never been great with words just the same as I've never been great with living with my own mind. 

Fast forward to 2019/early 2020. The global pandemic. I was a key worker through the pandemic. Going home to my 2 beautiful children and my soul mate after extremely long hours on the job. Not wanting to go home so I could protect my children but never wanting to leave their sides at the same time, a strange feeling that I'm sure many of us had during the many months of the Coronavirus lockdowns. I would cross paths with my partner when working during these times, I'd come home and she'd be off to do her own work working nights on the frontline during the pandemic. At the end of 2020 I took a month off work due to a significant flare up of my mental health, one I hadn't had before. I couldn't bare to continue with my life, I kept this quiet from everyone around me apart from my workplace. 
I went back to work 4 or 5 weeks afterwards, not 100% and quite low , still under the same rules and presures of day to day life under something so strange. After another month or 2 I began to keep waking up during the nights with an awful sense of fear, that ""gut instinct"" kind of feeling. 
I later found out that my partner was cheating on me after 14 years together. She quickly ended the relationship and things really went south with my mental health aswell as our relationship. Lots of horrible things happened as if I'd been some kind of devil, awful accusations ect. I continued to struggle on at work for a couple of weeks when things became incredibly unbearable in what felt like the click of the fingers - I didn't want to live anymore and that i would end my life after this very shift. This feeling was incredibly strange looking back to it now, it was like I had no more worries. As if every single thing that I had been carrying for a huge amount of my life had just been lifted off my shoulders. I left work feeling incredibly low but at the same time rather calm and collected about my decision. I drove about 40 miles to a secluded location and had a cry to my favourite songs, stroked the cheeks of my children on the screen on my phone and that was it, I swallowed 2  bottles of pills, 1 bottle of pills being my antidepressants and half a bottle of co-codamol. I wasn't upset anymore, I was more angry about my short life. I remember going lightheaded and after that I don't remember anything other than waking up in hospital remembering what I came back to, it upsets me still. 

I'm still struggling to this day with these feelings of betrayal. Remembering everything like it was yesterday. I have became incredibly jealous because I feel as If I'm not good enough, not good looking enough,  Don't do enough and whatever else. 

I'm not suicidal but feeling like the end of life could he close and could save me from my tormented mind. 

I have tried speaking with councillors and doctor and whoever else, I was told from a councillor that ""you're not depressed, you just need to get up and carry on"". I get that, I do need to but how. How do I pick myself up from alot of torment and trauma.

I find it really difficult to connect to people because I feel like other people just don‚Äôt understand. I was married at 19, got pregnant shortly after and my ex-husband turned into a raging and abusive alcoholic. I left him 3 years ago. A little over a year ago, I shot myself in the chest. There‚Äôs no way I should be alive right now. In fact, I did die for a brief period. Yes, I was getting help and on medication. I wanted to get better. But I guess at some point, I couldn‚Äôt go on feeling the way I felt anymore. I couldn‚Äôt sleep, couldn‚Äôt eat, and was always trapped inside my head. After all of this, my ex-husband tried to take my daughter away from me and filed a restraining order. No, she wasn‚Äôt with me when I shot myself and I never put her in harms way. Fast forward, I have 50/50 custody of her. I met the man of my dreams about a year ago and we are planning on getting married, but he just got two year orders in the Middle East.

I‚Äôve heard people say that when you are in a manic state for so long, it‚Äôs usually followed by a depression because your mind doesn‚Äôt know what to do with itself and is essentially directionless. If you think of mania as a high, coming out of it can feel like a real low.

I have been down, it‚Äôs not really affecting my ability to work or socialise necessarily, but the second I get home I just lie down and can‚Äôt get up until I have to again. I just feel low, there‚Äôs no other way to describe it.

Is this something I should look into before it spirals into something worse? Is it just the natural progression of a manic period?

I think i\`m at my lowest right now, been feeling empty and without a purpouse these past months, stuck in a job i dont want, my girlfriend just dumped me and i constantly struggle with my childhood trauma of abandonment.

I dont wanna give up just yet, i've been there before but this is different, cant feel sad or happy, just stuck. Cant sleep.

Usually i stay up to 3 or 4 am talking to myself, chugging a bottle of alcohol, i know it does more harm than good but it makes me feel comfortable for a bit.

The only thing keeping me happy was my girlfriend, now i\`m all alone, never had friends to begin with, she was both my girl and my best friend. I dont blame her for leaving, sometimes i was too cold or lacked touch, but its not my fault i guess, never knew better.

I'm filled with so many newfound emotions, used to hate myself so much i couldn't look at the mirror. Now it\`s weird but i see myself as that poor kid who had to grow up with no company at all.

How can i stop feeling that void in me ? I\`ve tried therapy, exercise, arts, anything that people would just recommend you and nothing worked, videogames are the only thing i can cling to right now, videogames and alcohol, they seem to be my only friends now.

Except that one way. To be fair, I tried that way, too. 

I'm here to present an alternative way of looking at the constant state that is depression. I don't look at it as a stigma anymore, I look at it as a sign. A sign that things are odd and not right. If it's me, Ican sit down and evaluate me, and come up with a way to address it. If it's not, and sometimes, it isn't, I work my way through it until it's something I can do something about it. It's a companion at this point, something that's going to stick with me for the rest of my life. And that's OK. I'll have good days and bad days.

I‚Äôve always lived behind a dense fog of shame for just existing. 

My parents told me it was weird that I was so young but I‚Äôd completely zone on coloring for hours. Dissociating at like 5 years old??

I used to bang my head on concrete when I was little (3/4?). Big emotions that my parents shut down. 

Just the look of disappointment of my parent‚Äôs face was enough to send me into a spiral of shame and guilt. 

My parents had to basically force me to eat at times. 
 
I was too scared in 1st grade to tell my teacher I threw up. I barely spoke to anyone in school for years. 

I always cried at the drop of a hat. Especially if someone told me I was wrong after finally speaking up. 

I would sleep for 16 hours a night if my parents allowed me. 

Never had interests. Couldn‚Äôt keep friends. 

I have always been utterly exhausted. Never been able to open up to people. 

I learned very young that I‚Äôm not my own person. To sit down and shut up. To be seen, not heard. That I don‚Äôt get an opinion. That I‚Äôm not allowed to have wants and needs.

1bjhsvb,i hate being autistic,"  
(20F) 5 years ago I was diagnosed with Asperger's. At that time I didn't feel reflected and I didn't want to know anything about it, but after a lot of failures I realized that I am much less functional than I thought. I don't have any social instincts and even though I internalize the things I observe in the rest of the world, I don't quite understand them or feel them as my own. Everyday things like greeting (anyone) make me uncomfortable, it is difficult for me to manage my body language and I have to overthink even the smallest detail of what I do, even with my family and friends. I rarely feel on the same page with anyone and I have never been able to talk to more than 2 people at a time in my life. I don't know how to approach people at the faculty, I'm always alone, and I can only discuss things with my friends. (No one wants to do ""extroverted activities"" with me) I could improve my social skills a little since with practice things start to come a little more naturally to me but essentially I will always be like that.  
It feels a little like everyone is gaslighting me and my only way to roughly guess what to do is to think obsessively about how other people see me. I took antidepressants at the time to control anxiety attacks and my social functioning decreased significantly, to the point that my best friend stopped talking to me.  
I don't want to dwell on how deficient I am, but believe me, it goes beyond my will. I always ran into the same problem and always repeated the same cycle of hope followed by disappointment. I find it almost unbearable to think about what I describe and rationally I feel almost absolute hopelessness. I feel that at least I won't be able to disappoint myself because it is impossible to get something worse than what I expect. Lately I have extreme emotional lability and it only bothers me because it makes it difficult for me to continue with my life, because beyond that my only interest right now is to draw up some guidelines so that my life is less unbearable.

1bjhhse,Tackling a depression living space? ,"Hi all, I'm here for help because I'm honestly getting more and more suicidal and desperate and I feel trapped and don't know where to turn. Any advice on tackling this is appreciated. My boyfriend and I live in his mom's basement and have for about two years, ever since our house we previously lived in caught fire. We both struggle with depression and things have gotten really bad. I'm ashamed admitting all this, but the basement can't be walked through anymore without stepping on garbage and clothes. Our possessions are constantly getting ruined and broken in the clutter and our cats have peed on a ton of things. Just this morning a vase I made in high school that meant a lot to me shattered. There are pee bottles everywhere because my boyfriend often feels that's easier to do than going upstairs through everything to the bathroom. One half of the basement flooded a bit and it's wet and starting to mold the garbage and clothes. It will take at least a full week of effort to clean and that's if we don't work which isn't an option. This isn't one of those ""oh, just get rid of the garbage first, then get dishes out, then get laundry in the laundry room, then put all the things back in their place!"" situations (I say this because that's what all the articles online say, but we don't have places for things.) We have too many clothes for our single dresser, we're paycheck to paycheck right now since we're 26 and just put all our savings into starting a business with no funding eight months ago and work six days a week (often seven, business is going well, though, and it's the one thing I'm truly proud of) and only get 4 hours at home each day before bed, the kitchen sink upstairs can't simply get our dishes put in it because my boyfriend's mom struggles with depression too and has years of her own things built up in there, and there's just so much down here and up there TO clean that it feels totally impossible (plus she doesn't want us to touch her things). We only use disposable dishes now, and that makes me guilty too. We don't have many things that truly have a ""place"" in here. We've made breakthroughs on it before and gotten it about a quarter of the way done with the cleaning on several occasions, but our whole life is in a basement when we had a house full of things and everything piles up all the time and gets really overwhelming really quickly. We've been saving for a house but are at least a year from getting it. It's gotten to the point that the only place to exist is the bed, and it's all I can keep clean. The house as a whole, upstairs and in the basement, is disgusting, frankly. My boyfriend grew up like this, and I didn't - my family is full of clean freaks and I feel like I've failed all the time. There's not even a place I'm comfortable sitting in the whole house that's not the bed that we got about a year ago since it's genuinely the only thing I feel like won't get dirt or something on me by sitting on it. My boyfriend's mom has terrible paranoia issues and we could never get the house professionally cleaned as such - she won't even allow contractors in to fix things that could be dangerous to her, everything has to be an emergency before it's taken care of even if we want to pay for it.

1bjh4j9,Do I have depression?,"Hi, I am trying not to self-diagnose and kinda want to vent on the same time. So here goes.

I don‚Äôt have any hobbies/interest. Even games that should‚Äôve been fun do nothing now. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I felt happy. Even if I somehow won the lottery, I think I‚Äôll just be on the bed everyday and not try to do anything else.

I lived most of my life with almost no social life. If not for school, I wouldn‚Äôt have interacted with my peers. I did hang out with several of my classmates during college and in addition met a bunch of acquaintances. After we graduate, we all just gradually drifted apart.

The same thing happens now. Aside from work, I don‚Äôt socialize. The thought about ‚Äúmaintaining‚Äù a friend/relationship feels exhausting. To make it worse, I‚Äôm having a really hard time trusting people. No surprise that no one tried to reach me.

I feel like I‚Äôm just wasting away at this point. Went to a psychiatrist that gave me meds but don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good for long term.

Any comments would be appreciated. If not, thank you for reading this :)

If your reading this I am so sorry that I've done this to you I just can't bare with this life anymore, none of you are at fault really. everyday is become repetitive even if i try change things up  school is making me so much worse I wish they could just understand me, there's so many people out there that hate me for no reason when I've never done anything to them. I'm sorry for being alive honestly I'm shocked I'm still here. I love you all I swear you guys are the reason I made it this far. i just feel so drained I don't feel like I'm gonna make it in life, clearly I wasn't made for this world anyway. everyone hates me for no reason they turned me into this when I haven't done shit to them. fuck I wanna be the old me so bad even if I still went thru bad times when I was younger I didn't feel as bad as this. I feel like no one truly loves me except my family. I'm so fucking ugly omd. I love summer but I hate the short clothes that come with it and my eczema gets so much more worse I feel like nothing can help it. I hate my fucking hands.

Note for mom (translate to romainian for her)
mom I love you so much you've always treated me so well every time something went wrong you were always there to comfort me, even if sometimes we argue we always turn fine in the end. this is not your fault at all you've done your best to help me. I love you so much and nothing would ever change that. I hope you recover from this and succeed in life. I'm sorry I'm dead I know you tried your best to get me help and I know your going to go through hard times when u read this (when I'm dead) school and people are too much for me to handle. I love you so much

Note to dad (translate)

Dad you were always there making jokes and making everyone laugh,I'm sorry I don't talk to you that much I really hope you can forgive me. I'm just too tired to go on living this life I don't even want. I'm so sorry and I love you so much. I hope you succeed in life

Note to isabella.

you were always there for me making me smile, everytime you knew I was sad you would always help me. thank you so much for being my sister your so awesome and you were always kind to me even if we argued we forgot about the arguement like 2 hours later and would go on walks. I'm so sorry one of your sisters is dead but I can't go on I've been trying for too long. you were such a big part of my life in the best way possible. thank you so much. I love you don't forget to stay strong make sure no one tells u nothing that make u feel down and If they do go sort them out because they are all insecure little bitches who are so bored with their life that they make someone else feel bad about their life because they just can't stand seeing someone happy, but honestly stay strong don't let this bring you down. i hope you succeed in life

Note to sister

You were nothing but funny and calm, everytime I was mad or sad you would always make me feel better, youd always argue for me with no hesitation, like I wrote about isabella, don't let this bring you down, you guys have eachother and that should help, please don't let me bring you down stay strong and tell rude people to fuck off because they aren't worth your precious time. I love you so much. i hope you succeed in life. you went through so much yet your still alive, your a true survivor. I'm so sorry I really hope you can recover from this I never meant to hurt anyone.

note to Zara 

I'm sorry for everything you've been through, I can't believe how much a person could understand me and I thought you should know that you mean so much to me and you should never feel bad because of someone. if anyone makes you feel down it's because their so depressed about their own life's that they try to bring someone down with them. honestly I feel like your the only person I can talk to without being scared that you would leak it. I'm so glad your still here and you got the help you needed, even if you have some bad times it's just a natural part of life, shit happens but you just gotta make it through to prove all them people wrong. ilysm and thank you for being here, I swear I tried my best.

i wanna kms so bad rn, it's getting worse I can't help myself, schools making me feel so depressed all my friends are leaving me out even if I try include myself, I don't feel like I belong here. they always ignore what I say and I have to go by myself everywhere and they don't wanna walk me to the toilet because apparently I'm too ""bossy"" but I don't think I am. they my only friends I have other then my fr friends aqsa and omaima. sometimes I can't find them though so I'm stuck by myself or with my other ""friends"" we used to be the best friend group but now they only care about radiyah. I clearly don't mean much to them anymore. I wanna hang myself so bad rn but I don't want to leave my family, they are the only ones who understand me. I don't want my mom to cry neither my sisters or my dad or anyone else, I'm trying for them. I'm gonna try win this battle I've been fighting for years. I wanna selfharm so hard but I can't because I don't wanna get caught. they thought I'm better and they probably think I'm just making jokes out of school and taking the Mick out of them but I'm trying, this school is filled with awful people that don't care a single bit about what your feeling as long as they get popular or attention, I've been trying to hold myself together forever but I've been getting worse in school. I want to have a future but part of me thinks I won't make it that far. What has happened to me. I just wanna be normal. I miss the girl I was before school. please help me Im so ugly. I wanna slit my throat open. there's no end to the pain bruh. it's gonna continue until I die. life can come with ups and downs but it's been down for too long. why am I still living. why am I not hanging myself right now. please. I'm so sorry if I ruined anyone's life, I'm just a bitch that ruins people lives. I feel so bad for being annoying.I'm sorry for being alive but imma think of changing that soon. Hopefully some day I just jump off a bridge. people at school keep insulting me yet they expect me to ignore it when I'm so sensitive? JUST FUCKING LISTEN TO ME. STOP MAKING EXCUSES FOR MY EMOTIONS ACTING LIKE THEIR YOURS!? fuck. school has drained me so fucking much and I just wanna slit my wrists and bleed out. people keep telling me these feelings are temporary but they feel like an eternity. i should of been murdered the day I was born. I didn't mean to be annoying or anything. everyone just ignoring that I'm obviously not okay.  my phone dry asf even when it's not on dnd mode.
nobody ever understands me, please just kill me. I keep imagining myself dying soon anyway. I don't wanna hurt people. why do they always hurt me. I'm sorry for coming into your life, clearly I didn't belong there, I don't wanna see my mom cry or worry but I always end up making her worry. I'm such a bad child. my hearts so heavy

26/2/24 12:19

the cycle starts again in a few hours, I don't want to do this anymore, my WiFi always gets cut off at 11 now and it's so annoying because I can't go sleep before 11 even if I try force myself or even relax myself, I'm just gonna be stuck in an endless loop of my thoughts and this note, schools making me so depressed right now. my bffs have their own bffs that obviously mean so much more to them, my friendgroup cares about radiyah more then me now even though she just joined it, so much for inviting her in because she was being left out of her other friend group. now I'm the one getting left out. our trio was perfect until she joined and made it four people. three people now. they replaced me, I feel so empty bro. all I do is start arguements for no reason man. I wanna kill myself but I don't want people to feel bad.I can't stop crying my heart hurts. 3 year friendship gone down for a 3 month friendship. I feel so unloved. I love too hard man, I don't feel like anyone understands me. I saved someone like me though, she's getting the help she needs now. she said that she couldn't of done it without me and that makes me feel better but I still feel like shit. damn people really hate me huh. I love my family so much, I think they love me too. I enjoy playing with Isabella but at night when she leaves the thoughts just come back. I think I have depression. I can't go a day without thinking of killing myself. there is no end to the pain.
I hate school so much it's 6 hours of expericing hell. no one understands me there even though they all think they do. I wish someone understands me. is this world even real. the only thing getting me through life is music and my family. without them I woulda been dead rn. I keep trying to starve myself but I can't turn down food. I'm scared people won't like me because of my body and my hipdips. this world is shit. it's all gonna go down one day. I'm so happy our lives are temporary. people with perfect life's make me jealous.  why can't someone truly care for me. every night, every time I'm alone, every time it goes quiet, before I'm about to sleep all I can think about is ways to kill myself. I'm only 12. please stop my pain. I just want to have a fun happy life like the other people, I wanna be skinny,pretty, funny and all that. I feel so fucking ugly. I love my boyfriend even though I get obsessive over him he still calms me down and stays with me. he's someone other then my family that understands my feelings. I think he's the person that knows the most about my life.

I don't have anywhere to put my feelings except for this note. I don't think anyone understands how bad I've been getting. it's been like this for over 1 year, thinking about suicide everyday, selfharming, getting angry for no reason, I just want it to stop. I just wanna feel like a normal person. these teachers are making me feel like shit even when I'm trying my best. ""(name) what is this , this isn't enough"" clearly plastic surgery won't be enough for you. fuck. stop making me feel like this. I feel like a shadow everyone ignores. I lost all my friends. I hate my life, why does it have to be this hard. why can they have the perfect life and be happy after they destroyed mine. why aren't they getting karma. fucking dipshits. I just wanna cut myself untill I bleed out but it's not like I can because wtf am I gonna do if it doesn't work? go around walking looking like I'm some zebra? no thanks. fuck I just wanna kill myself. but I don't wanna leave my family behind me. they care about me so I don't know why I feel like this. I ordered stuff online for 10 quid so atleast I have something to look forward to. I barely made it through today, everyone's just messing about and talking to me like I'm some type of animal. I've done nothing wrong I don't understand why they keep doing this, they know how it makes me feel yet they keep fucking doing it. what are these heartless dogs doing in school ""this school will help you with bullying and mental health"" clearly fucking not because I'm getting bullied Infront of you and your choosing to ignore it. my eyes for school just fucking worsened I don't think I'm making it far in life. at this point not even music can help me get through lessons, I hate everyone here. please just stop hating me I don't know you. parents need to learn how to raise their children because clearly this world is going to shit.  I always end up setting a date for my death but I never go through with it because I'm such a pussy. I just wanna feel alive again. I fucking miss my old self when I didn't care how I looked, what people were saying to me. I just wanna escape this life.  no one will ever understand me even if they think they Do. no one knows me more then this note knows me. ""give me Ur phone"" ""no"" ""are u hiding something?"" yes this fucking note since everyone wanna be such a bitch to people who haven't even done shit. I just want someone to notice how unstable I am and not make fun of it. I miss how fresh cuts looked on my wrists but I can't do it  again because I'm in forced recovery. cutting my internet at 11pm isn't gonna do shit with me being late for school. it's my desire to die when I wake up making me late. ""Ur too young to feel like this it's just a phase"" clearly it fucking isn't because I've been in this phase for so long I feel like I'm never getting out.

7/3/24 11:04pm

I fucking hate school so much, I wouldn't wish this pain on anyone. all the teachers think they understand me and that I'm just a bad person but I swear I'm not. I'm not trying to be late or have an attitude i cant fucking help it. they texted my dad about how im being late too many times like wtf atleast I actually came to your lesson instead of not coming. ""wheres your homework"" idfk bro I was tryna kill myself the other night because of this shit hole. they all want me to do better but they don't understand that I'm trying. this world is so fucked up bro I feel so bad and stupid. I don't think I'm gonna make it far in life. I literally hate myself. I hate my thoughts. I hate my mind. why am I like this. I just wanna be happy please I've done nothing wrong. I wanna become the best version of me but obviously I can't. this life feels impossible. I already settled on my decision to kill myself soon. even if I don't want to I know its for the better to just leave my family alone, even if it will make them feel bad soon they will realise I was a problem. I walked home from school crying and atleast someone asked me if I was okay. this world is such a fucked up place. what did I do to deserve this. I seriously hate my life. I'm gonna kill myself but I just dont know when. no one understands me. their all fooled by the fake version of me that I put on. I'm nothing better then a freak. I just want to be a child again.

The most likely outcome is I lose my stipend and will be working at Walmart with a masters degree in physics/astrophysics. A resume has been made and I‚Äôm sending out job applications now.

1bjfe6r,I feel empty and alone,"28m. All my life I have treated people the way I would want to be treated. The golden rule, supposedly a great thing to live by but it has served me nothing but putting me to the lowest point in my life.

I‚Äôve never had great self esteem and was a very shy child. This has carried into my adult life. While I am much less shy now, I still really don‚Äôt like myself. I tend to search out approval and validation from others, but I don‚Äôt really feel like anyone cares. I know I need to feed my own happiness, but it all feels so fake and delusional to constantly tell myself this while not getting much proof from others that this is true.

I feel as if I have no real friends, yes many acquaintances, but no real friends. Rarely do I get people reaching out to me, and if they do it‚Äôs mostly to vent or tell me about themselves. I rarely get asked about how I am while I will have entire conversations about what the other person has going on, how they‚Äôre doing. I will ask questions and continue the conversation. There is barely any reciprocation and the conversation just does after because they don‚Äôt ask about me. And when I get up the confidence to share a cool thin I did with someone they don‚Äôt really ask much more. Even the people who I will send funny reels to or a video or anything that I think they might like or find funny, they will usually just leave me on read or won‚Äôt watch or listen at all and just start talking about what they have going on. 

There have been many  occasions where I might not necessarily understand why someone does something but I will really make the effort to ask questions and try and understand, and most occasions I do. But on my side there have been so many occasions with my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù that they will actually say to my face that ‚ÄúI actually don‚Äôt really care‚Äù or they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt understand, but that‚Äôs fine‚Äù when I am trying to explain why I like something, or talk about something I maybe excited about , etc.

I also never feel like I‚Äôm heard. When I talk in a group everyone tends to talk over me. Yes I may do the same on occasion, but I will apologize after my interruption and ask the person to keep going. Sometimes I just feel like a ghost. People don‚Äôt move out of my way, they will bump into me or I will move out of their way. Sometimes I feel like I could disappear and not many people would notice.

1bjecph,Depression makes you self-sabotage friendships,"A lot of people seem to avoid others who are depressed, and it seems like the only way to avoid that is to avoid showing it or talking about it.

I try to limit my negativity as much as I can and have worked on coping skills to, you know, prevent myself from trauma dumping on others.

I don't trauma dump and complain like I once did, which is good progress. The damage is still there, though, from when I was a very hard person to tolerate.

Nobody owes you forgiveness, but I wish it didn't hurt as much to witness once healthy friendships just burn out. 

I understand how the other side feels. When my depression is really bad, I know I can be very difficult to be around and talk to. 

It also seems that people lose patience and distance themselves from that person. That's understandable, because I know how draining it can be to be around me when I'm in a depressive episode.

It feels like a lose-lose situation. You lose friendships that you once cherished, and so do the other people. 

The only solution seems to be to keep fighting, and I guess eventually finding people who are patient and understanding. Depression very much feels like a self-destructive illness, at least in my case.",xxGon,2,0,1710943802,depression

I spent hours researching methods tonight, and found a couple promising ones. I've even prepared what I need to get. Though I probably won't go through with it. And even these methods I have doubts about whether I could execute them.

Even still, I started the process of writing a suicide note for the first time. It's over 1000 words, not finished yet, but for something I'm not planning to do I am putting in so much more effort in than anything else in my life, really.

I cried writing that letter. Though, researching a suicide method is oddly calming. To me at least. Though I probably shouldn't find it calming or entertaining at all.

1bjalfc,Give me a reason I shouldn't kill myself,"I have been suicidal for longer than I haven't been, and I've battled with mental illness for my entire life. I've gotten the help, been to therapy, taken medication, I've even been hospitalized, at no point has it made it any better. At best, it has sort of stabilized me at times. I tried to kill myself 4 years ago, and there hasn't been a single time I can say I was happy I didn't succeed. 


All that being said, my question is why? Why keep going? What logical reason exists as to why I shouldn't be allowed to kill myself? Every single answer I've gotten, whether online or from therapist, is complete and utter bullshit. Every single response can be flipped on itself one way or another. 

""You never know, things may get better, so you should stick around to see""

Things may also get worse, so I should kill myself to avoid finding out

""It's a permanent solution to temporary problems""

It's not a solution to any problem, but it is a way to make myself have no problems

""You only want to make this decision because you're mentally ill""

But what of every single other decision I make? I have a drivers license and I work with children, every decision I make in regards to those is seen as sane. For what reason is suicide the only decision I make that isn't rational? 


""Your suicide would hurt other people""

Any reason given that involves other people isn't valid. There's no way to quantify pain, so whose to say the suffering my suicide would cause is greater than the suffering myself and others would face, given the decisions I make should I stay alive. 

""You don't actually want to die, you just want to right now""

Yes, I don't WANT to die, I've never wanted to die, even when I was preparing all those pills, I didn't want to die. I think death is the best alternative to everything else. I want to live and have a good life, but that is just something I am incapable of doing, for one reason or another. I don't want to die, I want to be dead.

1. Life insurance and long term sickness insurance policies and other types of private health insurance become more expensive if you have been diagnosed with depression.

Some of us will commit suicide, some won't find suitable treatment. I know, that it can be treated completely but it doesn't have to, even with therapy, pills, loving people around. 


What i have found comforting, is that, with being prone to depression, being neurotic comes certain sensitivity, that may allow us to understand each other and help those struggling.  I've found myself quite helpful with listening to others, giving proper advice and I wouldnt be able to do so without this depression. It is much easier to properly help others than it is to help yourself. One day You might save someones life because of what You are going through right now. Try to listen to others who you think might be struggling. Not because of selflessness, which I don't believe in, but becuase it is possible to find comfort for yourself by doing so.


This is obvious for some of you but it wasn't for me so maybe it changes anything for anyone. Although be careful, because it can become some sort of escape from your problems and those must be a priority.


This probably wont help those in their worst right now. Those peopleneed to think mostly about themselves and its okay, its natural and important. But try this when you can and are able to.

My mom was also emotionally absent and i was left to deal with all these feelings myself until it got so bad i threatened suicide then it was whatever prescription the dr recommended. I love my mom but sometimes it feels like she could care less about me until it starts affecting her. I see all these kids that graduated with me going into their careers and finding love and starting families and i feel so lost and dont know where i would even start trying to find a career. Im really tired of feeling like this i dont want to die but i dont see the purpose in living.,fragphul,0,0,1710922762,depression

1bj8b6j,Scared of life,"Hello. I'm there to whine about myself, write what's on my mind, what's bothering me.
I'm 24, on my last semester, in a process of writing my masters.

What's on my chest? I'm scared of my future. I really do not know what to do in a couple of months with myself. This frightens me a lot. Maybe things would be easier if I rented something instead of living in a student dorm as I maybe would have some idea how this works, but that would be too expensive so here I am. I really feel like I've failed at a game named life, technically simple sounding life situations being massive burden to me, making me feel as if it's close to the end of my life, not that it would be a bad thing in a literal sense. That's just one thing, but seemingly major at the moment, though there are many more things which stress me. What if my master thesis sucked, what if I'd skipped something during literature review for my thesis and everything would be invalidated? What if I suck at work, what if I will underperform at work, what if I say something that I'll regret horribly... this should give you an idea. Those feelings are paralizing to me. I feel insanely lazy, inadequate, procrastinating a lot, which is only making me even more anxious about things.

Another point is that I feel like I'm withdrawn from the society. I'm mostly making only transactional interactions with others. I'm generally interested in some things that are happening for other people but that's another transaction for me. I only query for some information that seems entertaining to me, to know more about someone, but for what reason? Just to entertain myself I guess. I don't find myself being an interesting person, which will only get worse most likely with my graduation. I'm seriously considering a doctorate at this point... but am I smart enough? I basically can only talk about university stuff, but what else? I can't really talk about my job other than that I'm a software engineer. Maybe I could have some small chats about anime. I find myself struggling with conversations, sometimes stuttering a bit, but having difficulties with finding the right words to tell what I intend to, though now when I think of it, do I really know what I intend to say? Funnily enough I can hold whole Oxford debates with myself in front of the mirror, at least I think they're pretty good. For now people seem to understand what I mean so that's a bit calming, though it would be nice if I could speak more clearly.
The previous point derailed a bit, so returning to me being withdrawn, I'm aware that there are concepts of colleagues and friends, the latter being technically the 'closer' one. I can't though grasp the concept of a friend. When someone becomes a friend? What are the things that friends are capable of but I shouldn't expect them from just colleagues? I remember once being to a birthday party of a classmate, when I was much younger but I remember being completely lost there, like I just went with whatever was happening there. I remember one thing that was pretty entertaining during the party though and this was fixing a sound driver issue on my classmate's PC. I've never really liked social events neither at school nor anywhere for whatever occasion, especially family ones, trying to skip as many as I could. A good question would be then, what I spend my time on? I've played games, spent time in my room, pretty much wasted a major part of my life. I despise myself for that. I sometimes wonder what could I achieve if I had some extra push? It doesn't matter now. I am where I am and there aren't time machines. I'd love to remove those last few sentences, since they're extremely embarrassing to me, but leaving them is maybe a good idea to just let it off my chest.

I feel like there's so much stuff I'd love to add, but I don't have an idea what. This makes me feel like I'm a dumb LM model just waiting for a prompt to generate some output. I think that to hold myself together somehow, I will turn to be a workaholic, just to find a purpose for myself, though what I wrote earlier about being anxious of makes me worry how I'll progress throughout my life.
I'm scared of a feeling of regression, my gray cells decomposing as I live, forgetting things I've worked hard to learn and remember. This feeling only grew within me over the years. I'm even anxious that I will accept it at some point in my life.

This should be obvious now, but I think it now connects some previous things - my romantic life being best summarized with a '0'. Do I feel bad about it? It's difficult to answer this question. Using my understanding of myself, I'm pretty sure I've never beared any romantic feelings towards anyone. I'm sure though that the only feeling I've had was pure desire, but nothing more than that. I don't understand what a difference is between a friend and a [insert sex of your choice]friend. I think that the only difference are 'bonus functions', lacking better terms. I hope this section provides a bit wider understanding of how I feel.
So I've established that I'm not particularly sociable, even when it comes to intimate stuff, valuing just the function. Yet I have an unpleasant feeling that I need some kind of interaction with other people, I want some unpredictability in them, but coming out and speaking my mind scares me. It scares me that they will find it unpleasant, offensive maybe. It frightens me that I might say something that I'll regret saying, which could have major consequences. It's not that bad prefering to have a chat with an LLM over a real human as they're not quite on a level to substitute a real human. I complain a lot, but have no one to listen to me, at least in the way I'd feel safe about telling something like what is written there and more.

The only form of happiness I get is when I finally solve some dumb issue, find an answer, everything in code works, that I find a short surge of satisfaction. But it's a difficult source and unreliable and what about the life? I absolutely don't know how to get that just from life.
In summary I don't a lot of things about myself, my mind, my lack of skills, my lazyness, my fear, my body, etc. I'm not sure if I feel better after dumping a bit of my thoughts in this post or if I'm just feeling sleepy, so those bad feelings will repeat themselves again, though most likely they will. I hope that someone will actually manage to read through this pile of chaos. Thank you.",DryAccount0,2,0,1710921888,depression

1bj5vjw,routine changes (with ramadan) / venting and figuring stuff out (positive),"i guess im just sorta venting and figuring some stuff out about my depression so im writing it down, maybe it might help someone or someone may relate to it.

i felt i was doing pretty good lately so i gradually came off my meds in january - it was a low dose (10 mg prozac) and for a long time i felt i didnt need the meds anymore. they really acted as a mood stabilizer for me and prevented agitation, but lately, with a bunch of confusing and kinda difficult recent events and the feeling of being lonely had made my depression much worse and i was having harmful thoughts again so before it got too bad i started my meds again.

i did realize though, that i think literally just a couple days into ramadan my bad thoughts became aggravated and even though i wasnt fasting the first week, i think the fact that i was having dinner much later, avoiding eating around fasting family members, and having a terrible sleep schedule, made things much worse. i love ramadan and understand its a very important month for spirituality but i realize for the past three ramadans at least, even when the season was warm and sunny, my depression has been the worst. i think knowing that my drastic change in routine may be an issue, is super helpful because i used to think there is something wrong with me and im a bad muslim so i avoided getting into my faith, but knowing that i need to focus on my routine and its ok for me to take meds and stuff is really helping. i feel like i have both an understanding of my situation, and the tools i need to address it. its liberating in a sense, to know that im not a bad person, and there are steps i can take to try my best to get the most out of this time that is important to me.

im already noticing a big difference - of course my meds are helping a lot i think (they work pretty quick for me), but even just accepting that a change in routine is ok, and figuring out how i can manage my time to get the most sleep, nutrition, and activity i need to stay mentally healthy, is providing me the energy i need to take opportunities to connect to my faith.

of course, the impact i experienced may not apply to everyone and i understand that everyones struggle is different. i guess im just glad that i had this win to be honest and figured out this big mystery ive had for the past few years. and if sharing my experience and analysis/reflection does help anyone else, then that would be great",applepiegirlie,2,1,1710911692,depression

1bj5n4j,i‚Äôve written my suicide letter,"here it is: 

i‚Äôm not really sure on how to start this so here. By the time you've read this hopefully I'm dead. I've always had a pessimistic outlook on life and I never wanted to live past thirteen. I knew I've wanted to die since I was born. Nothing ever made me happy, Nothing filled the void in my chest. Nothing made my life worth living. The world would be a better place without me. Every single day of my life I've thought about killing myself and after several failed attempts hopefully this one worked. I wasn't smart, funny, pretty or a good person. I'm a piece of shit that got what she deserved. I've always struggled with depression but no one believed or took me seriously. Depression has always been this thing that followed me around and no one could see that I was struggling or even bothered to help me. Not that I have anyone to blame besides myself. I knew the only thing that would make me happy was dying. I've always seen death as a second option. Something freeing in a way. Even if i did get the help i needed i would‚Äôve ended up with the same resolution. I never saw myself graduating or going to college. I'm not good at anything and have no hobbies, passion, or motivation. Senior year has been the absolute worst year of my life and I've never hated myself more. After losing my best friend I knew nothing in my life would be worth living. I'm sorry to everyone I've disappointed and let down. I take full responsibility for what I've done because this is what I wanted. This wasn‚Äôt an impulsive decision either. I know this is what I want. I felt numb and empty all the time. I knew I wasn't alone but no matter what I felt alone. I felt like there was this huge gap between everyone else and me. I hated everything and didn‚Äôt see the point of functioning in everyday life. I'm tired of never being taken seriously and all of my problems being overlooked. I'm tired of being a people pleaser and being a doormat.

to my family, don‚Äôt blame yourself. This was a well thought out decision and something that I've been wanting to do. I'm sorry for being a troubled kid and putting you through the worst. 

Mom: I love you so much. You were my everything and an amazing mother. I know we had our differences but I couldn't have asked for a better mother. Thank you for always being there for me and helping me save up for the car. all of the money can go to you, shanelle & dad. I appreciate you, you have no idea. I'm sorry I never told you how pretty I really thought you were. you‚Äôre so beautiful. don‚Äôt blame yourself, you did nothing wrong. My favorite memory was our shopping sprees that we‚Äôd go to when I was younger and we‚Äôd go to macys. 

shanelle (sister): i love you shanelle. you were a second mother. I hate having to leave you but I will still always be there. continue to be the amazing, hardcore marvel fan that you are. I love you so much. you were the best older sister anyone could ask for. I'll miss all the times we laughed. I hope you continue your nursing career. you made me so happy or at least what i considered happy. My favorite memory was all the times we‚Äôd eat food and watch our shows together. i always looked forward to that. 

dad: Thank you for everything. You were an amazing father and I will always love you. I'm sorry we never spent much time together but the times we went to dinner were my favorite memories. you‚Äôre the best and you tried your best and that‚Äôs all i could ever ask for. I know you wanted the best for me and I'm sorry I could not give that to you. My favorite memory was us jumping on the bed together when I was younger. I've always kept that memory. 

maggie: Maggie I love you so much & still do. Even after our fallout I never had an ounce of hate for you in my heart. you were one of the only people who i felt truly got me in my entire life. i‚Äôm sorry that i wasn‚Äôt a good friend to you and truly wish things between us would‚Äôve ended differently/didn‚Äôt end at all. After our friendship ended everything in my life changed and in no way shape or form am I blaming you because once again this is something I wanted. you‚Äôre going to be an amazing orthodontist and I can't wait to see you succeed in the world. Thank you for helping me find out who I really am. My favorite memory was when you and I would sing to the customers at cinnaholic and they‚Äôd all stare at us. 

casandra: casandra you were an amazing friend to me as well. We talked about so many things and you were there for me and we talked about things I've never told anyone. You are so smart and always knew exactly what to say. You are everything I want to be as a person. My favorite memory was our late night facetimes. 

taylor: you‚Äôre so sweet, kind and sensitive. never change. I love you too Taylor, I'm sorry for always messing up and ruining everything. never change. My favorite memory was our bottoms movie day. 

shaleya: i love you so much and appreciate everything you‚Äôve ever done for me. You were the only consistent friend I had and you were there for me all year. I'm sorry I didn't say how much you meant to me more often. My favorite memory was our October spirit Halloween era. 

l christle: i love you so much. you always put a smile on my face no matter what. you were one the funniest people i‚Äôve ever met. you‚Äôre going to do great things in this world. i know it. never change either. My favorite memory was that one time I came over to your house and we stayed out really late. 

to all my friends I could‚Äôve said more but i don‚Äôt have the energy to type that much so sorry for this shitty letter.

Sometimes the feeling comes from ""there is no point to anything, so why not"" or ""I'm just so exhausted; i dont want to do this"" or ""life is too unbearable and its not gonna get better.""

 I have self harmed but not to die, but because I was in too much pain and I needed a distraction. I live at home with family and if I didn't, I think I would just let myself rot and die from starvation.

There's always been this logical part of my brain that overrides my feelings and says ""feelings are temporary; just wait it out."" Lately, suicide just feels like it makes sense. I've tried exercise and that helps a little sometimes. I looked up what to do when I feel like this. I don't think I'll ever use the help hotline. The other big tip was to contact someone I trust to talk about how I'm feeling. But I can't find it in me, to trust anyone right now.

The one goal I‚Äôve had in life that actually mattered to me was to get married and have children, but unfortunately I‚Äôve come to accept that this will likely never come to fruition (I know it‚Äôs very old fashioned.

I only have positive emotions about life for maybe 10 minutes each week, and then I go back to feeling terrible and empty. I‚Äôve been going to therapy for about 3 years now, I‚Äôm currently on my 4th therapist who I like so far, but I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm getting better. She‚Äôs lovely to talk to, but it‚Äôs not helping much. I have also recently started taking medication, which I‚Äôm desperately waiting for it to work.

I had this stupid thought that when I turned 18, my depression would magically go away. That since I finished high school, I wouldn‚Äôt be in pain anymore. But I‚Äôve only gotten worse. I have trouble sleeping and staying asleep and my thoughts get so overwhelming that the only way I can cope is through I self harm. When I started I thought  it was going to be a one time thing, but now I can‚Äôt stop.

I also hate that depression makes me feel unloveable, that since I‚Äôm sad nobody will never love me, and that I don‚Äôt deserve to love anyone because of it. I understand love is human and I crave it so back but I can‚Äôt help but think it‚Äôs selfish to put that type of burden on someone else, so I just continue to be alone. I wish I had someone else but maybe romance isn‚Äôt for me, maybe I‚Äôm the type of person who deserves to be alone. But all I want is so desperately to have someone else, someone who loves me and will talk to me. 
Why can‚Äôt I have that?

I know I‚Äôm young and am probably trying to rush into stuff, but I think I‚Äôm in such a hurry because everyday it feels like my world‚Äôs ending. Everyday my thoughts get worse, everyday I contemplate suicide and I just don‚Äôt know how much I have left in me. Which is why I guess I want things to go well for me now.

And I guess I hate depression because it‚Äôs not fair. I see other people live their lives without depression, and it‚Äôs just not fair. I don‚Äôt want this, I didn‚Äôt ask for it, so why am I being tortured. It‚Äôs not fair that I have to live the rest of my life like this. It‚Äôs so not fair. Why can‚Äôt I just be normal, I don‚Äôt want to have these issues anymore. Why can‚Äôt I just live like normal people, why does my life have to consist of so much pain.

Emotionally, retaining that neutral feeling becomes a huge uphill battle.  I can come away from an interation having the full awareness that, at any other time, it would have seemed neutral, but during depressive episodes, it just *feels so bad*.  This is the illogical nature of depression on display.    


As someone who is usually able to control his emotions fairly well, this is always super frustrating.  I have come away from some very neutral conversations today feeling unwarranted things like fear and extreme sadness.  I even have thought about going to the bathroom to cry.

Starting from a terrible childhood to becoming too self conscious to even look people in the eye, never had friends or close family to relate to, rotting/missing teeth, covered in scars + nerve damage, destroyed my body health wise and physically, dropped out of college (but the degree I was ""passionate"" on is worthless in the real world so getting it would have also been a waste), the list goes on and on.

 I feel like such a failure, it feels like whatever I do I will still be miserable in the end. Which is probably the case. I don't want to even bother trying anymore. I want to dissappear.

One could argue that since I'm still on the younger side I can turn my life around and get that happy ending but I don't believe in that. Everytime I tried it was squandered one way or another. And, I genuinely don't understand people want to live. I envy them, actually. I wish I also had whatever magic they do to enjoy continuing in this hellhole.

I've never felt like I belonged here on this earth.

I just need someone to listen and have some type of human connection to stop my dark thoughts. I am so alone in everything I am dealing with and healing generational trauma while trying to be a good parent to my 8 month old daughter. I feel like every time I try to breathe something pushes me back under the water. I have had a very hard life. My parents were in and out of my life as they pleased, separating me and my siblings just to hand us off to whoever would take us whether it be aunts or grandmas. When I lived with my grandmother I was sexually assaulted by my cousin. I tried to tell my family what was happening and they didn‚Äôt believe me or just didn‚Äôt want to deal with it and shipped me off to my grandparents on my dads side of the family. The only way I can describe what this event makes me feel like is- dirty. I‚Äôve felt dirty since it happened when I was around 10 years of age. And often times questioned whether it really happened, but I still wake often to nightmares to remind myself it was true and to not accept being gaslighted because it‚Äôs an uncomfortable situation to deal with. I legally emancipated parents and was living with a friend and her family. Her mom was in my eyes a hero, until the checks stopped coming in for her ‚Äútaking care‚Äù of me. Everything quickly turned into a nightmare, physical and emotion violence became a normal everyday thing. I can still vividly hear her screams and things slamming while begging her to stop. My safe haven was crumbling. She put a lot of pressure on me and her kids because she had a rough upbringing as well. Instead of learning from her trauma she thought it was only fair we had a hard time too. She became a textbook narcissist- everything was about what she needed emotionally and would often confide in me her marital issues, I had to clean the house and pick her kids up basically became Cinderella. She was also doing a lot of cocaine which made her outbursts inevitable every single day. My boyfriend had seen what I was going through and moved me into to his parents immediately. Ten years later we are engaged with our beautiful daughter. I‚Äôm supposed to be my happiest now that I‚Äôm out of harms way and have everything I could ever want, but I feel so empty and broken inside which makes me feel so guilty. My thoughts are constantly consumed with what everyone around me needs, what I need to fix within myself, whether or not I‚Äôm a good mom. I feel like my feelings and thoughts aren‚Äôt even mine anymore. And I don‚Äôt want to feel this broken. I‚Äôm angry, resentful, scared and exhausted. I worry every second that If I‚Äôm not perfect all the time that I will fuck my daughter up like how life did to me. I can‚Äôt eat or sleep and having panic attacks where I can‚Äôt move my hands, they get stuck like crab claws. I don‚Äôt have resources or time for a therapist.  Please anyone just talk to me there is so much I left out I just need to talk to someone. I don‚Äôt want to bother my parent anymore with this he‚Äôs going through so much right now as well.

He told my mom to kill herself, that shes a terrible mother etc. and she always calls him every night asking about his day. I live with her and she never asks me. She doesn‚Äôt grocery shop for me because im 16 while she cooks for my brother who still lives with my dad and personally delivers the food to him. 

im completely unmotivated to do anything, but i still always help out around the house for me mom so she doesnt feel like im being lazy. i do the dishes, the laundry, i clean the house, i make her tea whenever shes feeling down and im really trying to be a good daughter. Im doing everything i can. 

I want to get a job since im doing so terrible in school. But i dont even have a card because my mom always complains ‚Äúwhat do you need it for?‚Äù and then complains i dont have a job. I dont get an allowance, whereas when my brother was 16 parents taught him everything, they got him a job, everything he needed to get him started. Even though he has a job, parents still give him money whenever he needs it. 

To add to all that, my brother has been sexually assaulting me whenever im near since i was 9. He did it infront of his friends to the point they started doing it to me. I ended up telling my parents when i was 14 and they completely ignored it. They took his side. 

im so lost, i dont know what i have done. they gave all these opportunities to my brother and i was just a cleaner to them that they would feed. 

My brother dropped out first semester of college and parents were completely fine with it. He has such an easy life, everything was hand fed to him. Our mom felt bad because he didnt get a birthday cake for him 19th birthday while i havent been getting anything for my birthday expect a sleepover

This all started when I was 11. I just began to feel down about myself. I would assault myself with ""my parents don't love me"" or ""your grades are terrible"". I've heard people complaining that teenagers have ""sad phases"", but usually those go away. Mine never did.

Whenever I hung out with family, I put on a fake smile because I didn't want to show my true self. They all gossip about eachother when the other is not around, so I wonder if they talk about me behind my back.

I turned 13 last year, and I thought surely the sadness would stop, but it never did. It just snowballed into self-hatred. My self esteem dropped. I call myself ugly every day. I usually blame myself for the hell I experience. I never told my parents, nor ever will. I know they won't understand, because they don't care. Hell, I talk with my teachers more than my parents. Pathetic, I know. If they won't take time out of my day to help me with school, or to even talk to me, then they certainly won't to talk about my ""feelings"".

For those of you wondering, I'm still waiting. Waiting for the day this hell ends. Waiting until my ""phase"" is over, but for now, I'm a 13 year old who feels like shit.",GamingGabriel01,35,23,1710884838,depression
1biw9we,How can I help my depressed bf?,"I (32 f) am in a ldr with my (30 m) bf for a year now. I sincerely love him because he is the type of guy I‚Äôve always wanted to be with, but never thought I‚Äôd be lucky enough to. For most of our relationship, we have been able to communicate well and consistently. Since late last year, he‚Äôs gone through some changes with work and school so I think the stresses of trying to manage them has gotten to him. When he‚Äôs felt depressed in the past, he‚Äôs gone quiet for a bit, but always reached out to me after a few days. This time it‚Äôs different. He‚Äôs shared with me that he feels things are getting worse, he has no motivation, basically going through the motions. When things are really bad, he said he can get into
episodes where he shuts down completely. I‚Äôve tried to do check ins here and there, but he isn‚Äôt responsive. I want to respect his space, it‚Äôs just a part of me loves him a lot and I want him to know he‚Äôs not alone. Sometimes I fear him being alone and dwelling on this can put him in a negative echo chamber. This guy means a lot to me, I really do not want to lose him. He hasn‚Äôt mentioned anything about breaking up, but I am so afraid that might happen. I‚Äôm trying my hardest to stay positive, but honestly with bad experiences dating, depression and both of us going through self harm in the past‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so worried for him.

Nous sommes amies depuis une douzaine d‚Äôann√©es, on s‚Äôest rencontr√© en premi√®re ann√©e de fac. On a √©t√© tr√®s bonnes amies, on a partag√© beaucoup de probl√®mes (TCA), et j‚Äôai appris √† l‚Äô√©poque qu‚Äôelle avait des traumas d‚Äôenfance particuli√®rement violents. 
Plus tard, on s‚Äôest perdu de vue puis retrouv√© pour √™tre √† nouveau bonnes amies, m√™me meilleures amies. Tout allait bien. 

Arrive le jour o√π nous sommes colocataires, et je d√©cide quelques mois plus tard d‚Äôy mettre fin et d‚Äôaller vivre chez mon ch√©ri car la vie avec elle devenait beaucoup trop dure √† supporter pour moi: elle allait particuli√®rement mal mentalement, en partie √† cause de probl√®mes professionnels, mais √©galement √† cause d‚Äôun √©tat d√©pressif li√© √† son pass√©.
J‚Äôai √©galement soup√ßonn√© des sentiments amoureux √† mon √©gard, et une grosse jalousie envers mon amoureux et mes autres amis, car m√™me si je passais peu de temps avec lui ou eux, elle se refermait et me faisait la gueule quand c‚Äô√©tait le cas. 
J‚Äôai tenu le temps que j‚Äôai pu mais je ne supportais plus d‚Äô√™tre sans arr√™t sollicit√©e pour ses √©tats d‚Äô√¢me, ses probl√®mes profonds, sa n√©gativit√© permanente. Sa simple aura me rendait mal √† l‚Äôaise et me stressait √©norm√©ment. 

Je me suis donc √©loign√©e quelques temps quand j‚Äôai d√©m√©nag√©, et la plupart des copains en communs que nous avions me disait qu‚Äôil fallait peut-√™tre m√™me couper les ponts, car apparemment, elle me critiquait √©norm√©ment dans mon dos. Beaucoup ont essay√© de me dire que cette amiti√© √©tait toxique. Beaucoup ont arr√™t√© de lui parler. Je suis la seule maintenant.

Je ne compte m√™me plus le nombre de rendez-vous avec elle que j‚Äôai subi juste pour qu‚Äôelle ne soit pas seule, alors que je voulais juste m‚Äô√©chapper.
Parfois √ßa va mieux, (elle a m√™me enfin pris rendez-vous chez un psy, elle a une ch√©rie (relation √† distance), elle a chang√© de travail‚Ä¶), et parfois elle va mal et j‚Äôai l‚Äôimpression que tout le malheur du monde, c‚Äôest de ma faute.
Et l√† malheureusement, depuis quelques semaines, c‚Äôest encore pire. Je ressens tout le temps de culpabilit√© aupr√®s d‚Äôelle, j‚Äôai l‚Äôimpression de ne jamais en faire assez √† ses yeux, et √ßa me fatigue tellement que je ne peux plus la voir. 
Le peu de fois o√π on se voit, elle ne fait que se plaindre, dire qu‚Äôelle va mal, que je ne l‚Äôai pas aid√©. Pas une seule fois elle ne m‚Äôa demand√© de mes nouvelles ou comment j‚Äôallais.
Recevoir un message de sa part, ou savoir qu‚Äôelle est pass√©e √† mon boulot quand j‚Äô√©tais absente me met mal √† l‚Äôaise. Je suis clairement √† bout, et j‚Äôai l‚Äôimpression qu‚Äôil est temps pour moi de rompre cette amiti√©. Mais si je fais √ßa, elle n‚Äôaura plus personne.

People are always saying it's scientifically proven that sunlight will boost your mood, but for me, sunlight actually makes my mood so bad that I feel worse than before. I have vision issues, so sunlight gives me a headache. I have eczema, so going out in the sun burns me and gives me rashes even with sun block. Additionally, I have a heart disorder and can't breathe in the heat, but I also have allergies so I can't go out in the spring. Then, for some reason, the thought of the sub still being visible at 9pm makes me more depressed. I probably feel more depressed in the summer, but even in the winter, I don't go out if it's sunny. Sometimes I'll go out or open my curtains if it's cloudy. Every day feels calmer and less overwhelming to me the darker it is. And if I ever need light, I have led wall lights that aren't too overwhelmingly bright, and I can adjust their brightness, unlike the sun. But, I wouldn't mind if somebody turned the sun off.

Even though I agree with all the people that told me she was toxic I just can't help but feel regret and remorseful on how things ended. She came into my life at a time when I was afraid of interacting with others and despised most people. For her she'd say I was her best friend and she'd make subtle and not so subtle attempts to be around me as much as possible and it made me happy. She started to thaw the ice in my heart just as I did for her as she would tell me she doesn't have many friends and the ones she does have rarely spoke to her and even more uncommon was them making an effort to see her. I was a change of pace for her as I made an effort to talk to her and see her. I'd be there for her emotionally as well as I hated to see her cry and she'd come to me to talk about her past traumas and things that were currently bothering her. It became a norm that when she cried I'd hold her in my arms and she'd allow herself to melt. It'd eventually be a norm where I'd just hold her even when she wasn't crying and this made me feel good just as it did her. I'd put head on her lap and all my problems would just go away. Now I don't talk to her anymore and as much as I know it's for the best it also hurts so damn much. Made worse by the fact that my previous job of which I got her to work there with me because I wanted to help her find work and she meanwhile said yes for that reason and because it'd mean we could see each other more. They told me after I stopped working there and a family member of mine spread a lie if me being dead she got depressed and had suicidal thoughts. I'd clear up the lie to her personally but a week after that is when I cut her off and according to my previous job her depression didn't go away. She no longer had those suicidal thoughts but her depression stayed. Soon enough she'd quit because of it and my job said if she didn't quit they were planning in letting her go anyway because her work had been sliding. My heart hurts that I can't talk to her but it hurts more to know that she suffered from this. Life for me has been going up since I broke things off.

So bad that all I've done in the past 2 weeks is the bare minimum work (clean bathrooms, empty trashcans, vacuum up crumbs under cubicles). Do I need to do more than that? Absolutely. But my depression has just been so bad that I have no energy to do much of anything. When my depression acts up at work I go and sit in my car for hours on end and just stare blankly out the window or cry. Well yesterday my supervisor came in for his weekly check ups (to make sure your keeping up with everything and doing everything correctly). Well he wasn't happy with my dusting, my lack of mopping, and not detail vacuuming. So after he left my manager came in and looked around. She also was not happy and warned me to shape up or I'll get fired and thought I was just being lazy. I had to fill out some paperwork stating why I was getting written up and that this was my only warning, and blah blah blah. I didn't explain to my manager that I have depression and that it's been acting up. Because I don't like to tell jobs I have depression because I feel like they'll only think it's an excuse. And I'm really not looking for sympathy either. I am doing counseling with my therapist and am on medication and he recently upped my dosage. But I still feel depressed most days. The only time I can say I am even remotely content is when I am at home with my dog and 2 cats. I don't hate my job either. I chose this job because I also have anxiety. And working retail or doing customer service in general just gets me to overworked and anxious. This job is very chill (most of the time, now when the call center has holiday parties, it's not chill it's very much a lot of work to do and clean up).  
Has this happened to anyone else? How do you manage your depression at work? I've also tried to get disability for my depression and anxiety but was denied. So getting on disability is not an option for me. Should I tell my boss I have depression? Would that really change anything?",SymphonicFlames,10,10,1710874775,depression
1biry6u,I can‚Äôt get my memories of my rapist out of my life.,"
Hi, I‚Äôm A, I‚Äôve talked about what happened to me when I was 6 in another post, if you wanna read it, you can check my profile, but it‚Äôs a little bit disturbing.


I‚Äôll get right into it, I can‚Äôt get him out of my mind, even though I left my old school, I feel like he‚Äôs still there with me, when I forget to turn a lightbulb on and I‚Äôm completely in the dark, it makes me remember the dark room I was in, and I‚Äôd feel him in the room with me, I could smell his scent, or hear him breathing and laughing, especially laughing, and I can see his figure, he looks like a shadow, it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs in front of me, watching me, or waiting for me to move, and when these things happen, my body just literally freezes, I cant move, I cant speak, even breathing gets hard, I literally stay in my bed till morning comes or till one of my family members open the door to get something from my room, but other than that, I stay frozen in place, staring at him and him staring at me and laughing, I‚Äôm scared to move, whenever I moved when I was young and he didn‚Äôt allow me to move, he would kick me in places that should not be kicked in. 

When I was 6, he used to bite my arm to get me to jump into the water since he was my swimming teacher, and now, I formed the habit of biting my arm really hard to the point of bleeding when I‚Äôm stressed or don‚Äôt wanna do something, and when I look at my arm after I bitten it, I remember everything, it flashes like a movie before my eyes


And I cant look at any painting the same anymore, I cant, in the dark room I was in, there was a painting in the middle of the room, the man n the painting looked like a silhouette of someone or a shadow of someone, but the eyes didn‚Äôt look like they matched at fucking all, the eyes of the man in the painting looked like they were cut out and replaced with his eyes, I swear. It was too dark for me to see, I could‚Äôve sworn I saw them blink or fucking move. Whenever I look at a painting, the eyes turn into the eyes I saw in the painting, I know it‚Äôs an just my imagination, but I have nightmares of that painting every fucking day

Everything fucking reminds me of him, everything, swimming pools, bite marks, broken light bulbs, dark rooms, paintings. I just cant fucking take it anymore, I don‚Äôt want to see him every time I close my eyes, I don‚Äôt want to

When i close my eyes for even just a second, a image of a man appears, I can see his features, but I can‚Äôt see them, idk how to explain it, and whenever I try to focus on seeing his features my brain starts hurting and I start to shiver, he looks like he‚Äôs bending down and smiling at me, it‚Äôs the same posture he used to do after he was done with me

1birr2g,"Tired of feeling alone, but I'm afraid it's going to keep getting worse","I fucked up my marriage a year and a half ago.  My wife and I were married 6 years, worked at the same company (how we met), until she decided to stay home with our kids around August 2022.  A few months later, I came home from work and told her about my day, which consisted of working on an emerging issue.  It was complicated to test, because it required using a special test rig and a temperature chamber, so I worked with the rig responsible (a female) .

Being that my wife and I used to work together, work was a common discussion for us.  I was so excited to tell her about this new problem, so I told her when I got home.  She replied with ""when did you start having feelings for coworker?""  I was and am still baffled.  I don't know how or why that was the conclusion she jumped to.  I don't and didn't have feelings for this coworker.  The problem is that the issue didn't stop there.  She continued to push the issue, never asking questions, always making accusations.  The accusations turned into arguments, because I wasn't admitting to what she 'knew' to be true.  The arguments led to yelling, cursing, and her telling me that if I wouldn't admit to this, that our marriage clearly wasn't important to me, and she would leave me.

So I told myself that if she needed me to be a bastard, so that we could work through this 'issue' and come out the other side, that I would do it.  So I lied and told her that it was true, and that I had feelings.  I've been talking with therapists about this and other issues, mostly about my childhood and how my father was a bully.  My father bullied me my whole childhood, I didn't get to talk and have a voice, I wasn't viewed as a person, and I learned to say or do whatever was needed to not make things worse.  I wish to god I had gone to therapy years ago and learned this about myself, but I didn't.  My wife is a very strong personality, which she learned from her mother.  She is also older than me.  I learned to just give in and let her lead.  So I lived this lie hoping that we could work through it and go back to 'normal' afterwards.  But she continued to make accusations that were unfounded, and the process repeated.  Her badgering me about what she 'knew' I thought, me not admitting to it, badgering continues, I relent.

I tried multiple times to tell her what I did, but she refuses to accept it.  She doesn't want to listen to me, she can't trust what I say.  I did this to myself because I don't know how to handle adversity and have difficult conversations.  I'm learning now, but it's too late.  I love her with everything in my being, and she resents me.  When I get home from work she's cold and distant, because she 'knows' that I've been looking at other girls, thinking about having sex with them, thinking about being in relationships with them.  I can't handle it anymore.  I have literally one in-person friend, and I don't feel like I can discuss this with him because I was shitty and distant while he was suffering through his own divorce years ago.  I don't have an escape, we live with her parents and her sister.  The only thing keeping me alive right now is our kids.

I know its my fault, I'm not trying to remove blame.  It just hurts so fucking much.  I gave everything to the relationship that I could and it wasn't enough.  It wasn't enough to keep her from thinking that I was straying, she was so sure.  I'm not enough as a person to keep someone happy, no matter how much I give.  We moved away from my family to be close to hers (across the street), when that house had water damage, we moved into her parents house, who also had her sister, husband, and 2 kids living in it.  We lived with them for a year while my wife and her sister fought like children and made everything so uncomfortable.  I made dinner for 10 people twice a week (at least) for the better part of a year.  I fixed up their house, I agreed to using my work vacation time to take vacations with her family twice a year, I am there for my kids, I worked in every way I could to show love to her and her family, and she still hates me.  I am nothing and I have nothing and I don't deserve to be a person.",Ok_Act_2424247249874,2,0,1710873775,depression

1birhn4,tearless crying,"a quick recap of my life recently:
me and my friend was planning to study abroad together, everything was fine and i even got the letter of acceptance for the scholarship but then my Visa got rejected because ""i was doing paperwork too late"" meanwhile theres no deadline stated by the school or the embassy..but my friend still got the visa (we applied for the same university and everything) and successfully went to study; the whole operation took my friend 6 months but ive been trying for 2 years now which makes me question my actual worth.

So thats one thing; right after a few days i failed the scholarship, my gf of 1 year dump me because she think we are incompatible and she had lost the passion a while ago; i always willing to take criticism,  communicate and change the dynamics in the relationship but all of that still not what she wanted and shes getting tired of us... It really hurt me that when the breakup havent happened yet but she already moving on.

My parent divorced last year, lots of traumas but i kinda moved on emotionally from it until my mom recently told me that she is seeing another person; i mean hes a nice guy, he helped me and my mom to a degree but i just cant take the fact that why i cant have a proper family in the first place with my biological mom and dad instead.
Again, seeing my ex and my mom moved on so quickly (good for them) makes me really wonder that did they really care about their relationship or not.

Also my grandpa is dying...

All these thoughts are messing me up real hard, i cant even cry properly, life is so shit right now its like a joke, every effort i put in something WILL fail miserably, i cant continue to study at my old university without having to answer how i failed to study abroad with everyone that asked. I literally have no self esteem left and my heart still aches everytime i think about my ex.

1bir71l,Hung out with a friend in the city after 3 months of near isolation. Got called a liar and old by some UNICEF guy (detrimentally) ,"It was a gigantic effort in the first place to get up and take the train. I even tried to look presentable, I put on makeup and all. This UNICEF guy approaches us and he was like the third in a row so I tell him upfront: I'm really sorry but I already know you gotta be 25 to even qualify for a donation and we were born in 2001. Now this mothetfucker, looks us from above and says we're lying. I know we look older, and it's mainly because we both suffer from depression and it eats you alive on the outside too. But he insists we're older, and then tries to justify himself by saying that many lie to avoid making a donation. I was like, you wanna see my ID? No matter how much I insisted he kept on insinuating we were at least in our 30s. 

I've been struggling a lot with my appearance and I gained a ton of weight the last year, I'm aware.

1biqxhq,Everyday.,"When someone does something to deliberately annoy you, when you get angry you're told to calm down and take a. Chill pill.
When you've been holding all those feelings in for so long nothing feels right anymore. Then it all hits you at once , hopelessness hitting hard , feeling you'll never be able to get out of here .
Drowning your self in social media , in bed , at night , seeing how everyone has better lives than you doing more in a day than you could ever in a year, all because you can't get up , what's the point . If you just complete the bare minimum:
Wake up .check
Brush teeth. Check 
Shower. Not today
Go to work . Check 
Come home . Check 
Finish up a bit of work. Later 
Sleep and get ready to do it all over again . Check 
People are so tiring why can't everyone just stay quiet , not be too nosy , hands to themselves, stop seeking attention and get on with what they were supposed to be doing and JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.
When you're at the lowest you've ever been and just stuck there like a flat line on one of those heart rate moniter thingys .
Ready to leave this world , no suicide, it only adds to the pain you feel .
""Life's short"" , "" life's tough"" , "" some things aren't meant for everyone"" 
Trying to cry? No , not a single tear, eyes so dry from last night , sobbing without the salty moistness on your face .
Outside is just as cold as your heart , spring's here liven up why don't you?
Fine. Just put that mask on everytime you go out, thicker than your foundation or concealer, bronzer or blush .
Full coverage , and when you get home, wipe it off .
Small things happen , but when you're at that point where you can't take anymore , it makes you burst , fire roaring in you ears, face hot ,feeling the strength in your arms and jaws , then realising you hurt someone.
It gets better. Right?

1biqoqa,i want to kill myself so badly but i don‚Äôt want to fuck up my family,"i just feel incredibly stuck. i‚Äôm so tired of being more interested and connected with other people (platonic or romantic) who don‚Äôt care about or like me nearly as much, and this pattern has been so consistent and fucking exhausting. i keep getting into romantic or sexual stuff already knowing that it won‚Äôt mean as much to them as it does to me, i know i‚Äôm just going to end up hurting myself but i keep fucking doing it because i romanticize and fantasize everything in my life like a stupid fucking optimistic idiot.


i hate that my natural mode is to be optimistic, i keep trying to find value in it but it just makes everything just hurt so much more.
i try to find worth in living through getting outdoor jobs and spending a lot of time outside, but what the fuck is the point? i love being outside but i‚Äôm just biding my time until i die, i don‚Äôt feel like i can actually change anything about the world or have any kind of impact so i just choose to be selfish and fuck around outside. all of my hobbies and the things i do to occupy my time are just distractions from the desire to kill myself, and they don‚Äôt mean anything at the end of the day.


i‚Äôve thought about different modes of suicide for such a long time, and i‚Äôve ultimately decided that it needs to look like an accident for the sake of not hurting my family as much. i was driving last night at 2am on these empty fucking rural mountain roads and i wanted to drive off the side and crash down, but i‚Äôm a coward and thought about the possibility of a slow death or permanently disabling myself or going into a coma or some stupid shit. so then i was thinking maybe i could be driving, go towards the edge, then shoot myself, but that obviously wouldn‚Äôt look like an accident. so then i started thinking about how it being ‚Äúaccidental‚Äù would fuck my family up regardless, so i feel like i can‚Äôt kill myself until they die. i feel incredibly selfish and just evil for thinking about that in terms of their deaths, like the loss of my family obviously isn‚Äôt anything to look forward to, but at least if i waited then i wouldn‚Äôt be a source of emotional burden or trauma to them while they‚Äôre alive. i wish they didn‚Äôt love me or care about me. 


i honestly don‚Äôt know if i can last that long but i know i don‚Äôt want to last that long, ive always thought i would die before im 30 not because of health or anything, but i just don‚Äôt want to be alive. i hate that i have a sister too, because then that means i‚Äôm going to have to wait even longer. i just don‚Äôt want to wait and i feel so fucking stuck and like i‚Äôm forced to be alive, im going to therapy and taking medications consistently but just like my hobbies and going to school, it‚Äôs all just biding my time and trying to cope with being alive when all i want is to die.


i don‚Äôt think ill ever get better, and i guess i keep wanting relationships where its equal and reciprocated because at least i can make someone else feel loved and happy (and that‚Äôs basically all i want for other people) but apparently the only solution for me is to constantly distance myself so im not the one getting hurt.

I used to think being an adult meant you gained some kind of instinctual understanding, as if you just knew what you had to do. I know that's naive, and it's not how it works, but for a moment I just wish it was. I wish I didn't have these problems, and I wish I could just figure it out. Everyone else around me seems to have figured it out, but what do I know, maybe they don't know either.

The future and present feels daunting, I wish I could grab my belongings in a big sack, and just run away to a quiet corner of the world, and just live out the rest of my days. But I need money for that, and for money I need a job, which needs a degree, which leads me back here. I have no choice but to buckle down, and just go forward, but it feels very daunting at times, despite my friend and families support. I wish I could fully see in myself what they see in me, but the feeling comes and goes.

He's been on depression meds almost all of our relationship together and it has had enormous effects on our sex life. He is not able to get a full erection - often barely a semi. About 5 years ago, I was going to leave him as we had a lot of issues (sex was certainly one of the bigger ones, but there were also trust and control issues), but I stayed around because he proactively shared that he was going to try to get help. Here we are five years later and he's tried pumps, pills, soundwave therapy and says he's willing to try some kind of injections. Sounds painful.

The thing is, i am 27, i am accomplished in my career, i am pursuing my master degree on scholarship, i have a lot of money for someone my age, i have been regarded as a physically attractive girl, i have two loving parents, i have travelled a lot, i have many friends who love me, but the failure of relationship and the prospect of dying alone haunt me so much.

I have had 3 past boyfriends, i became close to someone last year and it failed. After each failure, i think of how far i am on the prospect of having a family. The hard truth is, i really want to get married and have a child, but i seem to fail. I thought i am the toxic and the bad one always but i have lowered the standard for some aspect but can't seem to work out. Now i am talking to no one and i feel lonely eventhough i feel surrounded by people. I got diagnosed with depression on January and i am on medication, but i know this is just a temporary fix. The horrifying thought continue to haunt me, to the point that i am doing self-harm and have suicidal thought at times like this:

1. I know my friend's boyfriend is visiting and after 5 minutes of knowing that news, i had to go to my room because i had a major panic attack and i did try to hurt myself
2. One of my closest friend is getting engaged in february, she sent me the picture, i replied with how happy i am, but that picture alone sent me overboard and i did not go out for 3 days out of my room, barely eating and doing self harm again

I can't seem to use dating app anymore because it makes me so anxious, i run to self-sabotage. And i am tired when my parents point out how accomplished i am in every area of my life but when i look back it's so sad i have no one to celebrate my good moments with as my friends settle down and have their own significant other. I am so scared now to go back to my own country after master, i feel so ashamed in front of my other friends. I do want to commit suicide but i am a devoted Christian and i am still afraid of hell.",aknifeiturninside,4,2,1710865602,depression

1binpok,Getting better externally but getting worse internally,"20M

My entire life I have felt like i‚Äôve had at the very least a low grade depression from since i was an itty baby to now. Over the past 2-3 years i felt like making a change in myself and tried tk actively better myself. I lost 100 pounds and stopped being obese and overweight, formed new but isolated hobbies, connected deeply with friends, and continued working on my academic track in a field that make enough money that it won‚Äôt be a problem like it has been all my life. Despite this, it feels like internally I‚Äôve been getting worse. Two years ago I started having epiphanies thinking how much more comforting it would be if I wasn‚Äôt alive. A year ago I started to, in the background of the constant noise in my head, have formed a semi-active suicide plan. Now I have constant thoughts of suicide during the negative part of my mood swings. I‚Äôve been recently going to campus therapy and have a plan for a psychiatry visitin about a month, and am waiting on medicaid approval to find actual consistent mental health treatment outside of campus. It‚Äôs felt like as I try to make myself into a generally better person, I only internally get worse. My intrusive thoughts become more vivid, louder in my brain. I think believe that constantly say they love me are using me, or that they hate me. I think I‚Äôm worthless and unloveable. I have to lock myself in my room during the bad part of my mood swing and just lay still on my bed to get suicidal images to stop.

When my downward spiral began in 2021 I used to actively resist such ideations. Now these occur continually throughout the day and I have resigned myself to them. Right from the moment I wake up I am gripped by this urge to just rush to the 8th floor of the hostel I am staying at and jump headfirst. I am afraid that one day I might actually go through with it.

1bimysw,I can't cope with stress,"Hi there,

This is my first time posting. I have major depressive disorder, co-occurring with generalized anxiety, and cPTSD. 

At work, I have contacted the disability coordinator, and I have spoken with HR. My symptoms are very severe and I am on medications, in therapy, and I am in the process of TMS therapy.

Sometimes I forget things. I experience bad brain fog. I will have random panic attacks, or if I forget to take my antidepressant, I can't remember anything from the day before, and I feel like I've been hit by a truck.

Troubles aside, I have been a good employee. I get all of my work done every day. I have been so good and reliable that I have been assigned MORE work. For context, I am a legal assistant. I am a new employee and have been employed for four months, so sometimes I forget a step or make a mistake. Since I am a legal assistant, it's usually inconsequential, and fixable. However, my boss CONSTANTLY criticizes me. It's so bad I have panic attacks nearly daily.

She is aware of my situation. Disability services and HR have talked with her at length and my therapist has even written documentation with suggestions on how to speak with me and clarify issues. It's almost as if she just ignored them completely. She vacillates between praising me for my work ethic and ability, and criticizing me for the smallest thing (forgetting to enter time, WHICH WE CAN'T EVEN BILL SINCE WE ARE LAs) or forgetting to cc someone on an email.

I always gracefully take responsibility for anything that happens, and take steps to mitigate it in the future. Today I am at my limit. Yesterday I was swamped with my work, and everyone else's. I worked intensely until the end of the day. Throughout that day, I was receiving constant emails from her criticizing me. I ignored it on account of being entirely too busy for her bullshit. 

This morning, I logged on to work and the first thing I see is another email about entering a time slip. This time, for days I was physically sick. I hit my limit. I'm not sure if this person is being purposefully obtuse or if she is just an idiot. I am so angry, and I am so overwhelmed. 

On top of that, I forgot my antidepressant yesterday so I had vivid nightmares, I can't remember anything about yesterday after work, and I feel like I have been run over. I have absolutely hit my limit. I don't know what to do anymore.

I don't know if I should contact Disability again. I have been looking for new jobs but with no luck. I do not want to talk to her at all and I shouldn't be forced to. I am on the verge of another panic attack. I don't know how to cope and I feel frozen to the spot. 

Any advice would be appreciated, but thank you for letting me vent.",ThrowRAsistertroubl,3,1,1710862138,depression

1bim9kg,i'm 12. Please just help.,"Yo. I'm a 12 year old girl, I have overdosed or tried to overdose around 4 times maybe possibly more or maybe js that, how messed up I feel dude. (Not cuz the story, all b4 the story )My intense mood swings omg, but Ig i could kinda hide it at some level, but there's times where I don't just, mood swings. Kinda like now, but now there's just like.. kind of a feeling. Lemme explain; first I told friend 1 about how i felt pushed aside and stuff like when i kinda basically vent they could say how they had it worse or maybe just be like oh n stuff, then start yapping about some random topic, this made me miserable (it's a gc btw) friend 1 made another gc called talk for them to talk about how it was sad and stuff. THIS PART IS JUST. I CANT. So basically uhm. Yeah they apologized but guess what? MOST FOULDVE TALKED ABOUT FRIEND 1 BEING SAD AND CRYING A LOT AND BLA BLA BLA OH MY GOD, WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THEY TALKED AB FR1 MORE THAN APOLOGIZING. It made me feel more miserable dude. I can't. I can't. Even some couldve barley apologized. I think 1 could've not even, one made a cute art and yet pargrgaoh or long sentence w long letter font, they didn't actually upset me rlly, they were maybe the only one that didn't. Do you know how unimportant I felt? And the fact after settling things and saying bla bla bla I COMFORTED HER. HER. HER. HER. AFTER ALL THAT LIKE WH3N APOLOGIZING BLAH BLAH BLAH. IM SO DONE. AND SHE COOULDVE VENTED AB ME TO ONE OF THE OTHER PEOPEL?! DUDEE. AND I TRIED POSSOBLY SAYUNG SUM PERSPNAL AND SHE Could've been yapping ab herself, dude I cannot w her. Take not this all happened before but recently. I kinda vented maybe a night after we settled, UGH BRO OMG THE WAY SHE COULDVE BEEN TRYING TO PROVE THAT THEY APOLOGIZED TO US BOTH?? HUH?? OR SUM??! NO LIKE.. JS I.. IT WAS SOMETHING TO POSSINLY DO WITH HWR STILL. AND THEN I couldve been dry to her and like. Uhmm she apologized blah blah blah, and btw she did apologize b4, but eh. I had to first... Dyk how much that hurts. And recently she apologized again after me being dry but she also was talking ab herself sjs, but for her she doesn't see that I saw her message cuz I did some little hack, also with others, I enjoy people's concern, but they aren't really concerned. There's one girl she said she's worried but she isn't really uhh, just short message but she wasn't evolved she was one of the ppl that HEAVILY talked about friend 1. Another friend, friend 2 let's say, she pushed me aside a Lott but that doesn't mean the others didn't. Friend 1 and 2 couldve done the most damage, possibly, and maybe another, or maybe them all. Friend 2 texted (online name)? Like maybe they were concerned idk whatever but now something something they now prob know I'm alive, aaaaa, ok I kinda wanna end it but ugh, maybe I'm tired of life, am I overreacting and just really unimportant? Am I just some garbage? An emotionless pissant?? Dude. Did she ever think of the amount of times I comforted her. Or any of them. I'm sick and tired. And Infact I am sick, bad health. I still haven't replied, they see that I didn't ""seen"" the message- but how depressed I felt again, you know that feeling, like, worthless, useless, iykyk man. Their all around the same age as me, and irl maybe people don't really like me. I'm a werido aren't i? I cried on my field trip, did anyone notice? I was on a Google meet with my brkthers old friend (a girl dw)  and she kinda made it better but I hate it so so so much. And I remember my friends mom couldve ruined my 12th bday, how hard I cried on that day lol. And especially how hard I cried when I felt miserable from that gc. It might be hard letting go but I might need to. I cant do this no more with that filthy.. okay I'm sorry just so yeah! Hahahhaha. What if I overdose?? Again?? Huh?! Aaah what if I go crazy crazy and take it all ohhh should I would I will I? This close üëå bro omg. btw number of them prob didn't even apologize",Loud_Refrigerator831,14,15,1710860329,depression

1bim7y9,How I pull myself out of a crisis,"Remember a suicidal crisis typically lasts no more than 10-15 minutes. It doesn't really matter what we distract ourselves with...If we can JUST WAIT, then we will stay safe.

I know it's hard but just for a moment, put all problems aside. Stop running scenarios and memories.

""I am here. I am now. I am safe"". Repeat. 

STOP. Just freeze. Your mind and your body. Look around and find no current and immediate threat to your life.

Slow your breath, breathe a bit deeper because a brain without oxygen doesn't do much rationalizing, only panicking. Fuller, slower breathes. Don‚Äôt stop. 

Relax your tense muscles. You're in fight or flight, your body is geared up. We're ""un-gearing"" it.

Find something in every color of the rainbow. Red.
Orange. Yellow. Etc..

Feel your feet on the floor. Really pay attention to them. Feel the floor, grass, shoes.

""I am here. I am now. I am safe"".



Live in the immediate present moment as much as you can. The past is f‚Äôd up, it's not safe there. The future seems insurmountable, uncertain, like you're only ever going to feel the way you do right now (which isn't true!!!). And how are we supposed to live if it's always that way. The future is filled with too many variables and uncertainties, it's not safe either. (You can worry about the future when you are finally stable and come out on the other side of this shit show.)
One day at a time can be way too much sometimes.
Focus on the RIGHT NOW. Focus on calming your body and your mind will eventually follow. 
Even if that's all you do, all day every day. THAT'S OKAY!!! We hold ourselves to the highest expectation and we need to learn to give ourselves some grace during our healing journey. You've been through some traumatizing shit, I'm sure. This is how your mind and body survived. You're here now. And you're safe. And you will get through it. Just take care of your body the best you can. Try to love it even when you hate it. And the same thing goes for your mind.",Glittering_Initial44,5,0,1710860207,depression

1bikt6e,How can I help my boyfriend?,"My boyfriend (19M) and I, (20F) have been together for a year. Since the beginning of the relationship, I noticed he is very anxious and when stressed out, he tends to shut down. We have been working on communication and I think that he has improved with sharing his stresses and feelings with me. However, he still has a pessimistic outlook on life and gets really anxious when anything goes wrong, but doesn‚Äôt really take active steps to fix it. For example, if he woke up feeling unwell it would stress him out immensely, but he wouldn‚Äôt look online for advice or book an appointment, he‚Äôd just tolerate it. I think it‚Äôs noteworthy that he lost his father very suddenly during childhood, and went back to school without processing the death. For that reason, he doesn‚Äôt want to speak to his mum about what he‚Äôs going through, because he doesn‚Äôt want to be a burden on her/feels like she has it worse than him. 
I myself have struggled with SH in the past and have ADHD so I am not unfamiliar to mental illness. I encourage him so often to see a counsellor, which is free via our university. He‚Äôs convinced talking therapy doesn‚Äôt work but I still encourage him to go. His family life is complicated so he won‚Äôt speak to any of them. His friends are mainly from secondary so he doesn‚Äôt really open up with them. I‚Äôve also suggested he starts a hobby, tries to reach out to people on his course to make friends, write a diary or say affirmations but idk if he‚Äôs actually going to take my advice. 

I know we‚Äôre young but I really think we have the potential to get married one day if he gets over his trauma and learns to love himself.

We can‚Äôt leave u alone! U will be possessed!‚Äù I‚Äôm so tired. My family are so obsessed with jinn stuff. My state IS getting better, just leave me alone. Leave me alone.

Like, I will never amount to anything , and I‚Äôm only a burden to the people in my life, and sometimes I feel like there isn‚Äôt even a point in me waking up in the morning.

1biji6l,"stopped taking antidepressants for a month because i thought i felt better, can i start again at the same dose?","I stopped taking my celexa (40mg) and welbutrin (150) a month ago because i thought i didn‚Äôt need it. But since i started a new job this month, things have been a little crazy and i‚Äôve been depressed again. My job is going very well, but it‚Äôs my first ever job and it‚Äôs drained the life out of me. Not only that, since i‚Äôve stopped taking them, i‚Äôve just felt worse about myself in general. I started taking these meds for major depressive disorder. It‚Äôs definitely not as bad as it used to be, so maybe i can start taking a lower dose instead. Help?

edit: i also forget to take my pills a lot and that‚Äôs part of the reason why i stopped taking them altogether. im willing to get back on track to feel better.",ilovetartagliaajax,4,2,1710852752,depression
