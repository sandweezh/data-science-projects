I don't care if society says you have to do xyz to feel fulfilled or whatever, I just do what I enjoy. Now you may think that's dumb and won't work in the long term. But, When I think about things in the long term, everything seems so pointless, so therefore why shouldn't I do what i enjoy? Why must I conform to a system which honestly makes me depressed. To me, my life, my meaning and purpose is simply about living itself. About experiencing emotions and expressing myself, maybe about making the world a better place for people in some way! Now that's not really the goal that society wants you to pursue. You're expected to get a 9-5 job, get a big house and a family. All i'm saying is, you don't have to do that if it's not something you want to do. Just follow your own path and do what you like. I really hope this helped in some way and if it didn't I just want to let you know that I understand how you feel and I hope thats enough ig. :)",

Even if there are one thousand reasons you can\u2019t move past, that one reason to live will keep your head above water.\n\nSo.. breath in. Slowly and deeply. And when you let it out, let everything out. All of your hurt, pain, tears, screams, everything that you\u2019re bottling up. Release it. This is no longer your pain to bear. Let it out, take a moment to regain, then stand up and take a step in a new direction. You\u2019re here writing this because you know there\u2019s SOMETHING to live for.

I focused my life around two real close friends (maybe one was a bit more than just a friend); suffice it to say I messed things up and now\u2026 well you know. \n\nI think what I\u2019ve begun to realize is that it was a self-worth thing. I didn\u2019t like myself, but these two people I looked up to did, very much so. So whatever they thought of me, well I guess I valued myself entirely off of that. It\u2019s a dangerous thing, and it leaves you at the whim of someone else.\n\nI was on meds a few years ago, and I\u2019m looking to start again next week actually. I was pushing through the last two months without them and I realized things were only getting worse. With the meds, I would say talk to your therapist if you have one. The meds are great at breaking some of the stronger rumination, but they\u2019re not a one-stop shop you know? I wish they were, but they\u2019re not. Having a good therapist to work through these ups and downs with is so important.\n\nThere are parts of life we aren\u2019t going to like. We can work hard to pick ourselves up again, and it gets better, but it isn\u2019t overnight. \u201cEight months is a long time, shouldn\u2019t I be over this?\u201d A break up is a huge deal, emotionally. Especially if you pinned your worth to him, pinned your life to him, hid everything you didn\u2019t want to think about under him. It\u2019s going to take some time. But you\u2019re on the right path. It\u2019s nowhere near time to throw in the towel; it almost never is. You have this, you\u2019ve got this. It\u2019s in your hands, not slipping through. These weeks have been a temporary slump, but the general trend is upward.",

If not for something else, live for yourself. Live for the experiences that you will be able to have one day. Live for your favourite little spot that you go to.

Find places where you can put your mind and your thoughts, other than in your brain, if that makes sense. Being a depressed person is hard.

Don\u2019t do something u can\u2019t come back from bc of a stupid test. Here\u2019s to failing our exams tmrw. I hope you can get the help u need, or say fuck it and live the life you\u2019ve always wanted to. Please keep fighting.",

Once depression hits your thoughts shamble, you think much more about stressfull worrying things or you try to feel something for these dreams that were just a second ago euphoric to think about no longer after depression hits tho. The whole image of life goes south and some suicidal ideation may pop up, feelings become much more intense or much more numb.

(This is super important)\n\nSomedays just getting 1or2 of these done is all you can do. That's OK. Other days you will be able to add steps of your own. \n\nEach time you complete a task you should feel proud of yourself. You may only feel tired, but at least tell yourself \"I made it, good job\".\nYou tell yourself good job even when you don't feel you've done anything special. (That's a hard one to learn.)\n\nRemember your MDD is not your friend. It is not looking out for you. It's trying to beat you by putting stepfalls in front of you. It wants to win the war but it won't win if you win all the battles. \nYou can win the battles by doing the small steps. Each one you win, tell yourself that you are a winner!\nEspecially if you don't feel like a winner say it out loud. \"I'm a winner\"\n\nI know how dumb this can sound but it works. In the beginning it may not be visible that your making any progress. You will gradually gain ground against it. You can shave days off of your MDD. \n\nYou can do this and the proof is that you've come here for help.",

But not like this bad. My job is better than expected, I feel grateful about it, it is much much better than I thought. But still it is stressful. The reason I do my job and exercise is I feel like what I have to do.. not cause I want it\nNot like you,I dont have many bad pasts. I dont know why I feel so bad.  I thought I will feel much better If i have this job. Its been 6 month, but it doesnt. I know my crush to women affected very badly to me..but this feeling (feeling overwhelm from work)was already happened before I know about her. And it became worse .\nNothing is helpful to me. I think just following general suggestions(meeting some new ppl, do some things..) will be best, but I cant get out from my comfort zone. \n\nAnd bout your condition, I think it is just your body, brain, hormones working like that.  also you didnt mention about any alcohol useage. And about your sleeping hours. Hope they doesnt matter. \nHope there's a way to keep your blood something level like 2am condition.",

I cannot even make it to the store to get my necessities, blah blah blah. \n\nI went through a huge health scare and I live alone. There\u2019s one human that knows I exist and maybe kind of cares, but not enough that when I truly was doing everything I could to not off myself she couldn\u2019t be bothered to come peel me off the edge. She made a call to me. She knows my situation, my past, but she \u201cphones it in\u201d.  I only told her about the suicide thing because my counselor threatened me with a psych hold and that isn\u2019t happening. I\u2019ve got a chronic health condition and I\u2019m not going into a psych ward and trying to explain why I need so much medication. \n\nAnyhow, my cat is THE ONLY REASON I EXIST. I adopted her and she is amazing. But I made a life long commitment to her and now we\u2019re all we have and she\u2019s been through some bad stuff. Seeing how she\u2019s changed and grown through my giving her love, safety, comfort, food and a stable environment has made her trust, love, support and appreciate me because she\u2019s molded me to be her ideal human has been one of the greatest gifs I\u2019ve ever gotten. \n\nHere\u2019s to being 40 something and being depressed, at least we\u2019re still fighting. \n\n\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79",

However, you need to calm and  be easy on yourself so you can see things clearly. Are those people you see 100% confident, flawless, and perfect? You will notice that you have misconceptions and illogical thoughts. \nYou will start to resalize eventually that there are no absolute good people at all things or the way around. \nI can see that there are millions of people who are smarter, pretier, have much more fullfilling, healthier lives, and other priviliges, than I am/do, but I can also see millions of people who have worse lives, much more trouble, exteme financial or whatever kind of problem, less priviliges (education, skills, money, food, health, opportunities..etc) so it is just how life is, you can be better or worse than you were before or you are now depends on what you do ->\nDoing whatever contributes to your health and growth will make you better and vice verca.",

I don't know the full details of your situation, but I do know, from my life, how hard it has personally been to wake up every day with nothing to look forward to and still finding a reason to get through the day. I'm going to share a little bit of my life, but you know your life better than I ever will, so our struggles will never translate 100% because we've got very different lives. I know that for a fact. Even so, I'm not trying to invalidate your experiences, I see you, I hear you. Your feelings are valid to you in this moment, but it is a moment and it will pass.\n\nI used to have those thoughts daily, I wish I could say I didn't anymore. At least they've become much more sparse! What gets me through is knowing my brothers have had days where everything changed for the better in their lives and that they still have deep struggles even with all that they've achieved. If I had a time machine and it could tell me how much longer I'd have to wait till X,Y, or Z, or if I even get those things, I'd feel a lot better. I don't know if tomorrow might be that day or 20 years from now, but I'd sure like to make sure I live out this story to see those wonderful days that could be, because life pleasantly surprises me when I least expect it to. That's my take anyway.\n\nI'm not sure what kind of love you're referring to, but showing concern for your family and friend's feelings is definitely a type of love, is it not? What a good thing it is to still have family and friends! Don't sell yourself too short! I'm also still learning how to love people who hate me, people who've done me wrong throughout the years, and even just romantically, so no sweat!\n\nI'm glad you think you're not beyond help! I hope you try to find it because it is there. For everyone, I believe it's different. For me, it was my brother who I held a grudge against and didn't talk to for 10+ years. I would've never expected he'd gone through what he did and came out of it alive. He supports me so much when I'm down. It's just hard for me to ask him for help, personally.\n\nI still feel like with my parents sometimes, too. I believe it's their way of showing love, but it sure feels annoying to me. I just think one day, I won't have that anymore, and I'll miss them, you know? Do you think they have a right to feel worried based on what you've shared? Have you talked to them or someone else who'll listen irl?\n\nI'm dealing with addictions, too, man, and I just do what I can, every day. Sometimes, I fall back to them, but I just keep trying to quit, and that's enough for me right now. I can't provide for myself fully either, but I believe I will. I believe in you, too. Stay strong, brother! You're doing great, and I'm proud of you!",

But before that, make sure you go for walks. It will improve your physical health and mental health by clearing your mind and giving you a boost of confidence. I speak from self experience. If you are not of proper age, try to do some exercise at home, like the plank or push-ups.

When I dip into my really low lows I have to tell myself \"I can't keep doing this. I'm wanting to die. I have to try doing something else. Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result is insanity\". So I try to make a small positive change and to maintain it for however long I can. I slip back sometimes where I lose the ability to do things again (I'm looking at a kitchen full of dirty dishes and trash right now). But it just starts the process over. \n\nIt sounds like you are taking some positive steps in going to look for work. Take it day by day. Know the thoughts will be there and continue trudging on. Don't get discouraged- it can take up to a month to hear from am employer sometimes.",

So I'll just speak briefly about my experience (briefly cause I don't want Reddit to have toooo much of my personal experience on record lol.)\n\n* Journaling has helped me. I journal without a prompt and try not to judge too much of what I write. I just write what's on my conscience. Sometimes this has helped me figure out where to take action first be it getting more sleep, stopping drinking alcohol, understanding what has been bothering me about my childhood, or understanding childhood trauma. This is very similar to how my therapy goes in that it helps me explore my subconscious mind.\n\n* This is going to sound like an asshole take, but adult life is a rollercoaster. When I was severely depressed, I was so entrenched in my lows that I couldn't get out of the way and let the roller coaster swing back up. Some people have better support systems to remind them of that and help them provide them with hope and perspective to keep going, and some don't. But like the other comment said: try to keep going. There's opportunity out there.\n\n* Continue to get to know yourself. Things that you may have liked or the person that everyone told you that you were may not be the person that you feel like you are. You get to be the person that you want to be; you're the captain of your own ship. Give yourself a break and enjoy your-self. When you become an adult, you can give yourself the support that you always longed to have, be the mother/father figure to yourself that you needed and no longer have to necessarily rely on that person any longer... while still loving them.\n\n* and again, this is personal, but a lot of the internet babble is right: try to hydrate, eat properly, get sleep, exercise, get fresh air, get some sun. While your mind can affect your biochemical makeup, the opposite is true too: your body can feed your mind biochemical boosts. \n\nI'll stop there. Hope you can find a rhythm where you can put your young energy towards that what your heart, mind, and spirit desires.",

All that while looking for an internship and of course, studying because I will have exams starting early april. It's insanity and I'm drowning, and in the middle of that drowning I pushed back my subscriptions to continue my studies and I messed up, big time. Because now I have to deal with issues it's too late to fix. I was able to subscribe to the thing I wanted the most but I'm afraid that is the only place I will be able to candidate to.

Consider seeking out another therapist or psychiatrist who might offer new insights or be more willing to exploring the psych testing you feel you need.\n\n If you ever feel like you might act on thoughts of self-harm or suicide, please reach out for immediate help.

Sometimes you have to let people go, so don't keep trying to hang onto Zoe if she's ready to move on with other people.\n\nZoe has older friends and doesn't want to hang out with you and Lucy. Lucy is still your friend and she is comfortable with having younger friends, You can still hang out with Lucy, and you can be nice to her younger friends just to make Lucy happy, but you don't need to become friends with them.",

Go go go! Make friends! As an adult, its more a yellow light. Move with caution. Expect to stop and have to wait a while. Kids have no responsibilities. Adults have to generate money to live. Find a partner. Start a family. Manage a spouse, career, and kids first before friends gets noticed on the back burner.\n\nJust about every opportunity to meet and make friends feels like someone looking for ways to leverage you like a pawn in their game to elevate their own life higher. Can you make me money? Can you lead me to more money? Can you give me money?\n\n... I'd consider maybe looking for a puppy. Small breeds live longer. Longer than most friendships.",

My only thought is, maybe this is it and I have a heart attack or stroke and don't have to put up with this anymore.

I know this is just a rant but we're very similar. 29F and I spent many years in and out of facilities for 7 month spans for self-harm/alcoholism, so my own resume was like swiss cheese, constantly quitting jobs. In the end, the best advice I ever got was to put self-employed. They don't ask for business license or proof of income unless it's upper management financial jobs  (I briefly worked for the Feds which required credit score check and pay stub records). So putting that you had your own business, in my case, made it look like I had preoccupied myself with a side hustle during covid when I was simply just to mentally ill to stay consistently employable. I know you said you're not having any drive or motivation,  but if you ever do find some energy, maybe you could talk to your therapist about the idea of using that as a path forward? For me, and again it's a grain of salt since we're different people/circumstances, but for me it was like able to put on paper that I was organized for invoicing, self-scheduling to meet deadlines, and marketable given I had to establish a brand. In the end, what seemed like a farce job title on paper actually opened me up to real commissions in the art world instead of living a lie...and that's kinda the only saving grace of my own adulthood experience. I feel like a failure in socially, romantically, and fiscally, but at least I have art to enjoy on too quiet days, it's helped me acquire more skills as I pushed my capabilities in new mediums, and sometimes a stranger seeks it out to appreciate. Anyway, I don't think your therapy should help you come to terms that you're in an inescapable rut. My excel file in November showed I had 47 job rejections and over 200 applications sent. It just sucks, brushing off one's self when we're already so freaking low, yaknow? Nobody else will do it usually, especially if you had a rough unsupportive childhood/family. So I do hope you find your way and friendships, like I'm also looking forward to :) Take care!",

        "body": "Sorry that you're struggling.  I've had a life full of self-sabotage and isolation, and while it may feel safer, it does indeed just slowly get worse.  You can't avoid the pains of life, you can only have control over how you respond to them.  Accepting rejection and failure is incredibly hard, but I think it's necessary for moving forward.  It sounds like you're holding yourself back from experiencing life and deeper relationships, which isn't necessary, though I know why you do it.\n\nPeople generally aren't so great and will probably be disappointing a lot of the time, but to get the best things in life, sometimes you have to take risks.  If someone rejects you, it isn't your fault.  If someone isn't being kind and empathetic towards you, it's their failure, not yours.  It's hard not to turn inwards with your negative thoughts, but I think it's misplaced.\n\nThe same applies to facing the real-world.  It doesn't really matter what direction you take and if you \"fail\", what matters is that you stay true to yourself and try.  Think about what direction in life you want to take, even if it seems unrealistic.  Go in that direction and see what happens, even if it's not perfectly what you imagined when you were young (it won't be), you will be leading an authentic life and making progress.  If you figure out it's not what you want, then just change direction.  The only way you lose is by becoming stagnant, which is what I did.  Just take the first step.\n\nYou deserve happiness and all the things you want out of life.  Best of luck.",

The times where I had absolutely no hope for life, for the future, for the world, that was when I was closest to breaking in an unrecoverable way. Idk what I can say that will help. Maybe try practicing it or something rathern than passively waiting. Like, try thinking about the future which currently seems hopeless, and then try to change the perspective so it doesn't less hopeless anymore. It will probably be tough but maybe by doing it a bunch of times you might find some thought that works.  \n\nReading back your post I missed some 'interesting' things by reading too fast, namely this:  \n\n> I feel like im losing time and I wont be able to do any of the things I thought I would do. I feel like I have already failed before my life has truly began. I dont even want to die I just want to escape or even just start over. But sadly neither is possible.  \n\nThis is literally me and I haven't heard anyone really describe it this way. I'm 25M for the record. But I've been feeling this way for 7 years, and 7 years ago was when my life turned to shit. I don't have actual friends, or even memories of the last 7 years, no relationships, almost purely just shit and a waste of time. I regret it so much too. And I too feel like time is being lost. You probably also feel like you're on a timer if I had to guess, like things need to change NOW or it's game over. It's gonna be hard but try to work on yourself or your situation. This thing in the previous exercise might be a start, where you work on yourself by finding hope. I have hope that my future can be better, I can make it better. I try...and I've made progress, but not yet enough.",

I won\u2019t just say \u201cit will get better\u201d because to be honest I\u2019m 22, and I sometimes get depressed too. But I think it\u2019s normal. I think depression is something most people suffer from, even if they don\u2019t say it. But there are times when the depression is gone, and you see why life is worth living. And those moments make it totally worth it. Being depressed can feel like it lasts for ever and that it won\u2019t ever go away, but it does. Reminding yourself of the good times and happy times can get you through. As for your online friendships, it\u2019s natural for these things to end. The great thing about the internet is there\u2019s always more people to meet (although you should always be careful). At 13 all of these things can see awful and hard, but the truth is you\u2019ll eventually get over it. You\u2019ll make new friends and forget about the ones that hurt you. And talking with parents can be hard too. You should try talking to your dad about it or another trusted adult. They can get you help that will be worth it. If things are bad with your mom, try and think that it might get better. And if it doesn\u2019t, you can always move out once you\u2019re 18. But I think once you get older you\u2019ll start to understand your parents actions a bit more. In the end there\u2019s no point worrying about what you could have done better and if you could have prevented it, because there probably wasn\u2019t anything you could have done. It\u2019s never your fault, don\u2019t put that pressure on yourself. Although it\u2019s hard now, you have to push through till things get better. Life is about being strong. For yourself, and others.",

I now am a parent of two teenagers and understand depression in a much longer perspective. Personally, I think depression is an inside job. Other people like my parents may trigger my anger, but it is MY anger and disappointment in self. In reality. Depression doesn't really go away but can be something to accept and put into perspective. In a way, I manage life with depression rather than trying to understand it or make it go away. Trying to find happiness in the small things and good moments gets me through. Reaching out to vent is healthy in my opinion, it means you want to get perspective and feedback from others. Oh, and taking a walk really helps me when it gets bad.",

Some may be true but some things could be made up to make them look bad.\n\nYour online groups that split up and had problems really was not your fault and there is not much you could have done. Unless you knew the person IRL that they may have taken his life there is a real good chance it was just a made up rumor.\n\nAlso what other people do is in no way your fault.\n\nThat guy that betrayed you and asked you to let him talk to the other guy and bullied him you didn't know he would do that or know he was like that the only thing that you could have done differently would have been to ask the other friend if it was ok for him to contact him.\n\nYour only 13 try to not put so much pressure on yourself for the most part you can't fix other people problems and issues. If it's online or in real life sometimes friendships can become toxic and when that happens it best to distance yourself from those people. \n\nJust make sure you do what keeps you safe and your friends safe and if someone does things in your groups that your not comfortable with maybe it's best you aren't friends with them.\n\nIt's great you have looked into therapy and yes to get into therapy you need to have your parents set it up for you and they have to be involved.\n\nYou don't have to deal with this on your own it's great you have reached out on here and please continue to do so.\n\nAlso please consider talking to your parents about how your feeling and the things your struggling with it's ok to ask for help and accept it.\n\nYour right to think you shouldn't leave your siblings without their big brother and please use that to help you when your really struggling and feeling down.\n\nEveryone in your family needs you and wants you to be there so please consider asking for the help you need.\n\nYou have been through a lot and it's to ask for the help and support you need.\n\nIf your school has a counselor you could also talk to them, there should also be kids help phone services  in the area where you live.",

I thought I was going to get the typical response that I got from other elderly people.\n\n\nOne of them asked 'Why did you react that way?'\u00a0 I explained that I thought she was going to chide me for not being married by 38.\n\n\n(These two ladies who were about 80 had been best friends since they were teenagers, btw.)\nThey started to laugh and roll their eyes.\n\n\nShe flat out told me that I was a fetus and that I wouldn't even truly know who I am until maybe my 50s.\n\n\nMy point is we think that we have to reach a milestone by a certain age....and I understand why you feel the way you do I truly truly do..... I'm just saying that we're not as old as we think we are.\u00a0\n\n\nSure - to a 20-year-old were 500 years old (because they're stupid, let's be honest, we all were at that age lol).... But I just don't believe that your story is over yet. You seem like a really smart, kind, caring person and I bet there are a lot of good and wonderful things that you've always wanted that are going to happen for you.\n\n\nI fully understand and validate your feelings and i'm sending you a big hug.\n\n\nI just wanted you to maybe think from a different perspective if possible.\nIt's hard for me but I try",

I wanted nothing more than to be married and a mother since I can remember and yet I\u2019m still unhappy. If I could recommend a song\u2026\n\nEmbrace the power of pause with *'Vienna' by Billy Joel*. It\u2019s okay to take a day off or disappear for a while to focus on the things you want and need. It\u2019s okay to start over. I have started over many a times. Our life isn\u2019t over yet. We still have a lot of life yet to live (sometimes that thought scares me too tbh, lol.) To experience. Don\u2019t let time fool you into thinking it is over. You can still have your dreams. In the song he mentions that you can get what you want or you can just get old. No matter what we\u2019re going to get older, but you can still have what you want if you go for it! You can still have children and find a loving supportive partner. We can start eating better, exercising and moisturizing our face to help with our bodies aging. Money comes and goes. Don\u2019t worry, you can be financially stable again. What I\u2019m trying to do is fix my health issues so I can do all the things I\u2019m telling you to do. So I can be present in the moment, in life. So I can be living and spending time with my loved ones experiencing new things instead of just surviving and existing.\n\nMedication has also helped A LOT. Literally it is my life saver. It can only do so much, but that\u2019s why I\u2019m also in therapy and interested in different approaches to improving my life and my thoughts. You could give that a whirl, if you aren\u2019t already.\n\nAlso, I always cry when I hear that song because it\u2019s so beautiful. You can still get the things your heart desires <3",

But often in this world, the worst thing that can happen is to get exactly what you want. You might have gotten together with the wrong person and been stuck in a miserable marriage for the rest of your life. I'm sure we can all name a few famous people whose lives went off the rails precisely because they were handed the life they dreamed of (fame, fortune, admiration), and it led to excess/addiction/heartbreak etc.\n\nThe old saying \"man (human) plans, God laughs\" comes to mind. As someone of a similar age who has been in a similar position: there is some peace to be found in letting go of what you thought you wanted from life and establishing a new vision for your future. You don't need to be defined by an idea of life that you had ages ago. Free yourself from it, and allow yourself to start again. The advantage of being unattached is that you can do whatever you want, and at the wise age of 35 you're in a better position to design your life than you would have been in your 20s.",

It\u2019s nice to look young and feel healthy, but you\u2019re gaining something from this aging process - wisdom. The irony of life is we want youth but we also want peace of mind. The former is temporary and the latter requires time and practice and learning. If you can notice for a moment that what you\u2019re wanting maybe isn\u2019t what you think you want, but maybe a larger trend of living in a way of comparing, judging, assessing. Wouldn\u2019t it feel good to live and just be and say forget the expectations or what age I\u2019m at? Some people end up married with kids on the timeline you had hoped for and are miserable. I guess a thought I\u2019d have is now that you are going this direction what might happen? There is no right path because you are the path. When you start to feel and explore that you see how many people aren\u2019t actually living life in a free way they are staying very close to the paths they think they need to walk to be happy. What if this is all leading you to a place of peace within yourself? Hope something in here was helpful.",

As if doing better in comparison to others in certain areas of life makes us better people, but it isn't that simple right? \n\nI think we demean ourselves a lot when we think other people lived better and we did terrible, because as I find out in time, everyone has had some terrible times.

I didn't even know I was expecting things at times, but when I think back, I can see that I was. The concept comes from Eastern philosophy, the Yogis, etc which I want to learn more about.\n\nI feel for you, I feel the time flying by too and I am not a fan. But I think letting go of the idea that I need to hit XYZ milestones by XYZ age is helping put my mind at ease a little. I heard recently to try lengthening your timeframe for goals and see how it feels. If you had, say, 10 years to land in a new career instead of the 4 years most colleges take, you'd be much less pressed about picking the right college major, for example.\n\nAs for health/looks...

One thing that you should really note is that your mind can be your enemy, the worst enemy you have actually, and that's because its very malleable in that it can change your perception on a lot of things very easily, when your mind tells you that you're not good enough or anything negative about yourself, remember that it's wrong, it has no basis for what it's saying. You've had  a gf and friends , if your mind was right then none of those things would have happened. Also, go with the flow, don't question things too much, chill with your friends and don't worry about what you think about yourself since your thoughts are against you right now. Your character is better assessed by others around you than yourself and others around you seem to like you very much if theyre not the ones ending anything with you, even yoir gf didn't want tk end things with you so she hadn't had a problem either",

It's not.\n\nSure, everybody wants to look good. You know why? Because of sex. It's instinct. Women usually like pretty men and our biological purpose is to reproduce, so it's only natural that we have an innate, conscious or unconscious, desire to look good for them. But is it necessary to prevent death? Jokes on you, it's not.\n\nI can tell you ways to improve your looks, your mentality and so on, but I always think the problem lies deeper than that. Change starts with realization, and your realization needs to be of the insignificance of the questions you ask and the potential answers they imply. You are not obligated to do or be anything.",

It might make eating easier knowing you don't have to gobble up a big portion at once \n\nIf you struggle getting enough calories in, liquid calories in form of Protein drinks or such can help too. Just drinking them in between meals will help you get enough calories.\n\nHope these tips will help and wish you a good recovery from it :)",

        "body": "Well this is absolutely tricky, but first and foremost I want you to feel proud of yourself for reaching out for advice and also validated in your struggles because it truly isn\u2019t an easy place to be in. On one hand you want to be the best partner possible and support your bf through his hard time. You also don\u2019t want to bring him lower by ending things but on the other hand, you recognize your needs aren\u2019t being met and it\u2019s hurting you in the process.\n\nBeing on meds can strip you of absolutely every emotion you feel to a point of sheer numbness. I loved my friends with my whole heart, but I genuinely couldn\u2019t find it in myself to show it. I felt like a ghost existing outside of my own body and couldn\u2019t control it. It genuinely isn\u2019t anything personal towards you, and I think most depressed people can\u2019t see through the storm cloud above their head to see the people around them.\n\nWhen I was in a place similar to his, I felt like a failure at everything. It was like the harder I tried, the more I failed and eventually I didn\u2019t want to try at all. I didn\u2019t have a partner at the time, but my friends felt neglected by my usual care and attention. The more they tried to talk to me, spend time with me, lean on me for support, or even help me, the worse my depression got, which made them feel worse and they needed more. It\u2019s a vicious cycle. But I couldn\u2019t give the care or support they needed/deserved when I needed it too... Can\u2019t fill someone else\u2019s cup when your cup is empty. My advice? Break the cycle.\n\nAsk him what he needs from you. This does NOT mean you are putting your needs last\u2026 I\u2019ll get to this. Some people need space and time while others need an army of support. From this post, it sounds like he just might be overwhelmed by being needed and it\u2019s doubling down on him when you talk about it because he feels like he\u2019s failing. Emotionally he\u2019s shutting down as a result. I think if you give him the opportunity to air his needs and let him feel heard, it\u2019ll help with the communication a TON.\n\nIf he needs space/room to breathe, that does NOT mean he doesn\u2019t love you or care about you at all. Help him help you. He might be more present with less pressure on him, and he will feel less like he is failing. Provide positive affirmations when things go right, rather than bringing up the things he can\u2019t give right now. I think together you could build each other back up. Lifting him up will likely allow him to feel comfortable in a place he\u2019s doing things right and he might be better at support your emotional needs in return. It\u2019s tougher when meds are involved because it might not allow for this, but is it worth a shot?\n\nBut I also want to stress that if he needs space, think of it as an opportunity rather than a negative. It doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s giving up on you, it means it\u2019s giving YOU the room to breathe too and focus a little more on things that bring you happiness outside of him. Takes some of the pressure off him because he shouldn\u2019t be your sole source of happiness if he is. Take walks, read books, spend more time with friends, focus on your inner peace and fuel your own needs for now. He might not be able to fuel you right now but you can fuel yourself.\n\nNone of this is applicable if he\u2019s treating you terribly in the process though ie yelling at you, calling you names, etc. Then by all means get outta there, you don\u2019t want that for the rest of your life.\n\nRelationships are a lot of work and I\u2019m really glad you sought advice! I hope this is helpful. Stay positive OP, I think you two can come out of this stronger and closer than ever.",

In that time, everything went grey, I sobbed all the time and wondered the house without sleep for days. Everytime I ate something I couldn\u2019t taste it. Everything was bland, even the sunlight through the window blinds. But I got out of it. And even though I still get super depressed I never want to go back because there is something I\u2019m waiting for I guess? More experience? More time to pass? I was also so angry at the people around me I also forgot that they have struggles too. What made me get out of it was going to college. Doing stuff. Even if you can\u2019t make friends (I don\u2019t really have any still to this day myself) you can do things YOU want to do. Even little things. I suggest to self admit yourself to a hospital just in case. Hurting yourself is bad enough but yourself and others is the worst thing. You just need to feel again. Taste again. Smile or laugh again. It will come in time. But don\u2019t make the wrong mistake, of death. You can\u2019t come back from it nor can you bring others back either. It\u2019s a one way ticket. Seek some more help.

I've been struggling since childhood, started taking meds in my early college days, have seen multiple therapists, and yet I am still depressed. Everyday feels like a drag and I always feel low. I try to be grateful for what I have, yet enjoyment in life is hard. Things get thrown your way and you feel even worse. Then you realize your upbringing has caused you to be this mentally withdrawn as well. A lot of people feel the same way you do, so you are not alone. I'm in dialectical behavioral therapy right now and it's been helpful. I even have a great therapist. It has honestly brought me some hope. But it took me years to find the right resources.\n\nAre you getting professional help? There are a lot of resources out there. Finding a great program or therapist is hard, but there are truly passionate people out there who can help. Killing yourself isn't the final answer, though it may seem fast and easy. Keep trying because you can be strong and you can grow. I won't say life will get better, because life can actually be terrible. However, there are ways to get through it even when it's hell. And you don't have to do it alone. I really recommend finding the right fit for your mental health journey.",

Left me being a lonely dumbfuck in class who was fat. All the friends I thought I had, were only there to just be around me so that they feel they were not the dumbest. I was never a smart or handsome or cool kid. Used to get bullied, got shit on a lot. Parents used to compare between cousins in academics. I could go on\u2026 I\u2019m 24 but I still don\u2019t find a reason to live. \n\nI recently got into a relationship and guess what. She had mental issues. So the whole trauma came up and I tried to break up. But then she accused me of rape, and defaming her by having intercourse with her. She told she was pregnant to my parents and that she was forced to take pills by me. My parents hate me, her parents hate me, friends hate me, I hate me. I felt guilty. Im having flashbacks and I hear some voices also sometimes. \nI feel like sometimes the sounds just talk to you and shit. So moving on, my parents house arrested me now and I\u2019m kinda scared and being mentally unstable. Intrusive thoughts and etc etc \n\nSo my advice is idk if there is a reason to live but think of this question. \u201cWhat if tomorrow, I could genuinely smile?\u201d Try asking yourself this and you might see a small light kinda thingy (not like in movies) \n\nLemme know tomorrow if you do see it.",

It bothers me that people really think like that. Who would choose to live like this?\n\nI always thought I could find a healthy way to live on my own, just brushing it off. I didn't notice that I was on a steady downward spiral, messing up with addiction and such. Then life hit me like a ton of bricks. Went through a crazy hurricane, moved, and ended up taking care of my parents through the last few years of their lives. Even injured my foot and couldn't walk for nearly a year. All of this was barely two years ago.\n\n\nI was so unprepared for all of that. I handled my duties well, but in the end when I was suddenly all alone, I fell apart. A short relapse, unsafe sex, questionable decisions left and right. I became homeless and moved back to my hometown and lived in my car. I'm still homeless. Had to give up my two cats who I love more than anything.\n\nAll of this to say, I totally relate to your frustration. I've struggled hard with wanting to die. Or at least giving up on any kind of life. Hell, I haven't been able to hold a single job since everything happened. It's been a lonely time.\n\nMy single turning point so far was making a friend. He came out of nowhere, a fellow car dweller who was only passing through. But he treated me like a normal person, listened to me complain and genuinely cared. We hung out and took his two dogs everywhere. He pushed me to get motivated and got me moving again. Other people even noticed a difference in how I presented myself, saying I looked far less depressed.\n\nI felt a little pathetic for being so happy over a single, temporary friend. He didn't change my life or anything. I'm still homeless. Now I miss having him around and want to find another friend. So that's my current motivation. I want to pull myself together enough to make a friend. Now I know it is indeed possible for me to be happy again, to maybe have a decent life. \n\nI have a little bit of hope now that I'm desperately clinging to. I sincerely hope you find something or someone to give you hope too. As awful as I've felt, it blew my mind to even feel like that again. I just have to lay off the self-loathing and being so cruel to myself. I underestimated how much that was affecting me. \n\nI can't imagine what your life is like in your country, but don't lose hope in the possibilities. It only takes one thing going right to make a change. I'm telling myself this as well. It's been a hard day.",

They don\u2019t realize I\u2019m actually trans myself, and when I start asking questions I realize they just hate me because their news media tries to make us out to be enemies of their world with some sort of \u201cwoke gay agenda\u201d.\n\nI ask them to explain what the gay agenda is to me and they can\u2019t. I ask them to explain what \u201cwoke\u201d means and they can\u2019t. Then I ask them how can you hate something if you can\u2019t define why you hate it? It shuts them up. But it doesn\u2019t usually change their mind. Sadly, not even when one of their own family members comes out as gay/trans or whatever. These people wake up and choose illogical hatred.\n\nAnd yes it makes me sad that I work with people that are comfortable in sharing their awful opinions without knowing who I am.

Have you tried to show him how his lies hurt you and put his good reputation in doubt?\n What did he do about it? Soon he will be like a ghost to you, since what you see does not represent reality. Then, you will stop listening to him anymore, because u know there are more lies coming. As a result of ignoring him, you will start to feel alone and then divorce will come. \ud83d\ude14 I don't know what he lies about, money, women... the question is: What the other person does doesn't dictate who we are. He doesn't act like this because you're insufficient ( i guess ), he has his own issues. Don't get into a loop of hunting for your self-worth through any human being! Each head is a world. But I understand that you miss him, the presence of your special person. He has weaknesses that even the best human beings have. And believe me: it hurts him a lot too. As you are currently in charge of the ship, you need to strengthen yourself mentally, physically and spiritually to combat this challenge for your marriage. Marriage is great when we're having drinks in the Greek Islands, but it also involves the storms.\n\nI see a lot of people thinking, \"Why did he do this TO ME?\" No, beautiful, it's not about you. It's about him. It seems to me that it's worth trying to help him, so walk with him, seek specialized professional help. Look for specialized centers, attend classes, look for material about his deficiencies. If he's your man, don't let go of his hand. Men feel afraid, have traumas, insecurities too. In a long relationship, the woman is a lover, daughter, mother, partner, friend. I think your man needs his friend at the moment. Be strong and bring your man back! God does the impossible. \ud83e\udd0d\ud83e\udd0d\ud83e\udd0d",

The processes may take longer than normal, because the students need to sometimes ask their supervisor for help or assistance. These aren't first year students, they're usually third or final year students with lots of practical experience.\n\nCheck the websites of dental schools near you. All the best. \ud83d\udc4d",

It's honestly surprising, sad, yet intriguing to look back at my life and see the signs. Kind of like rewatching a movie to see the signs of the movie's well-crafted plot twist before it actually happens. My own depression has made me realize I am a lost cause. I am one of those unfortunate people that cannot be helped. One of those people who live to suffer. Was born to suffer. And I'm just supposed to deal with it. My life was shit in some areas, and I had (and still have) my own problems like low self-esteem and social anxiety, but at least my life felt \"good.\" Despite it, when I could just be in my \"happy zone,\" I felt like myself. Life I guess felt \"good,\" but that's the thing - seems like life never wanted me to have what I had because it just took it all away... suddenly. And I'm supposed to just pretend it didn't happen and continue living.\n\nMy depression is honestly confusing lol, and I still don't understand why I even am depressed despite knowing the answer. And even if I somehow manage to overcome my depression, guess what? I damaged my stupid self while depression and have adopted a nihilistic and more pessimistic mindset of myself and life, so that'll continue being with me. Not that I really care to be honest as I have no true reason to fully care. Everything is just... pointless. Confusing. And most importantly, stupid. I learned a lot while being depressed for 2 years, and it's rather intriguing to see myself be so observative about myself and life in general.\n\nNot sure if this' relevant to the post, but your title really made me start thinking about myself lol. Not exactly \"venting for support,\" just speaking my incoherent thoughts out loud in a public anonymous setting because words from a post's title got my brain going lol.",

Hopefully it starts to help more soon.  One thing I wonder, is if it's possible for you to find some kind of outlet/passion/distraction to keep your mind away from the void.  Don't pretend it isn't there, because you know it is, I think acceptance might be important, for now.  Hopefully you can fight it indirectly at first, by avoiding it and healthy life changes/treatments.  Once you get better, maybe you'll be able to tackle things more head-on and fully take back your life.  The way you describe it is like the eye of Sauron in LOTR, that must be horrible dealing with on a constant basis.\n\nI hope you find some relief soon and are able to make more progress.  I hope you can reduce or get rid of the alcohol/weed, as those things might be making things worse.  The internal shaming and insulting sounds very unwarranted, so I hope those types of thoughts go away as well.  You deserve happiness and peace.  It's very good that you're accepting treatment, and I hope you continue to fight.",

If you're in a state that's legalized medical marijuana, then that's highly unlikely.\n\nIf you feel that cannabis helps your symptoms, then I'd urge you to strongly resist any attempt to restrict your access. Do try and get a medical card. I've gone through this myself to some extent, as I have IBS. Cannabis doesn't completely relieve the pain, but it helps. There are precious few substances that help without causing undesirable effects of their own.\n\nThat said, nobody believes me that I use it primarily for medical purposes. I honestly couldn't care less, and neither should you. You're the one that has to make it through each day. If you feel it's helpful, disregard anyone that tries to tell you otherwise.\n\nIt's interesting that some are advocating a more pharmacological approach. I'm not sure what you've tried for pain, but frankly, you should be applauded for avoiding that nightmare. Most pain medications are far more addictive or habit-forming than cannabis, and they carry their own risks.\n\nWhile it's good to be aware of the risks, cannabis tends to be pretty damn safe. It's worth a shot to try and explain to your parents how it helps you, but IME I wouldn't hold your breath. Many still buy into the whole \"reefer madness\" nonsense.",

Even though people use it to help with anxiety, it can make your anxiety worse when you aren\u2019t using it. I\u2019ve been in and out of Mental Hospitals for a bit, and every other patient I have talked to has told me that weed is great until you become reliant on it. You can\u2019t relax without it and you feel like you are on the verge of a panic attack if you go long periods of time without it. I\u2019m not gonna act like I know your entire situation, but you clearly need something to help with your pain. Most painkillers are highly addictive and can be very dangerous. Just as, if not more dangerous than weed. It sounds like your parents don\u2019t fully understand why you use it, and if they do, they aren\u2019t giving you other options. I think they are just worried about you, but don\u2019t know how to help you.\n\nMy advice would be to research all of the negative side effects of weed and to research other ways to relieve your pain. Talk to your psychiatrist about painkillers and which ones might help you. Keep your parents informed on the whole process, mainly for their peace of mind. Just be safe about it and don\u2019t just keep using weed because it is easier than other options.",

You probably went to school, came home and went to bed and that was life. Brother, that's normal, safe even. And to parrot what everyone else is saying, and believe me, it annoys me as much as it may you, they're right when they say you have your whole life ahead of you. I thought I was so lost at 20 being in a small town and now that I'm 23 (only three years further down the track) I can see they were right. I just needed perspective. Don't look at life as levels you ascend through all together like you did in school. Everyone scatters in every fucking direction and tries things out, you can too. You have your health now, you have taken back a valuable part of you that changes the entire way you experience this world. You have plenty of time to make YOUR.OWN. WAY in this world brother. Don't look at your peers to figure out if you are where you should be in life, you have to look inside yourself to figure that out. Ask yourself the questions \"am I happy here?, does this job work for me?, do I want to do this for another 10 years? What is a giant goal I can strive to achieve? How can I break that goal down into actual real steps for me to achieve it?\". Don't rush yourself. As long as you wake up, you've won, everything else is a bonus. You'll be okay my friend.",

Like what have I really done with my life? Nothing really. But I'm also 24. Plenty of other 24yr olds haven't done anything yet either! Trust me when I say not having really done anything or accomplished anything at your age isn't abnormal. Now to the extent to which you haven't done anything is a bit extreme but at least you can say YOU didn't make that decision. At least you don't have to live with the fact that you're the reason you haven't accomplished anything. I had all the opportunity I could want really and I wasted it. I TRULY wasted it. Because I had it and I did nothing with it. You didn't even have the opportunity to start. (This isn't me trying to get pity. Rather I'm trying to help you see the bright side of this. Finding a silverlining in anything is a really valuable skill. Indespesible really for people like us who struggle with staying positive.)\n\nBut you do now! Take it! Don't let he fact that you had a rough start keep you from enjoying what you have left! You have SOOOO much more left! Don't let a bad start ruin it.\n\nI'm currently clawing my way out of a deep depression and even just today I asked myself why should I keep trying? My life has been good for nothing so far so who's the say it will get any better? Then I reminded myself that it's ME. IM the one who says things will be different. I have to make that decision for my own sake. No one else can live my life for me. Life is scary. But it's even scarier watching it pass me by. I'm done with that. It won't be easy but at least I can say I tried. I'll have days where it feels like too much and I want to give up. I'll have shitty days where I don't do jack shit and I'll feel bad about myself. But I'll fight to have at least one more good day.\n\nI truly hope you can find the strength to put yourself out there. I know it's scary, but it's worth it. You deserve to have happy days.",

In hindsight we are young and have a life ahead of us and the things that don\u2019t work out now could be for the bigger picture of what may happen in our lives later. \n\nIn the moment the feeling sucks cause it almost feels like it\u2019s your fault, but it\u2019s not. Relationships are already fickle enough, looking to more stable things that we have control over will help maintain our happiness. The right relationship will come to you when it\u2019s ready!\n\nHope this helps <3",

It's a good thing you realized you want something else besides family! I don't have much advice because as I said in the beginning, I too need to work on myself. But you could try maybe joining some of the events you mentioned. When an acquaintance is going to attend, maybe casually ask them about it, mention that you're curious and would try it out.

Only difference between me and you is that I\u2019ve never had good grades or nothing I\u2019ve just been a bed rotting 15 year old kid this whole time with nothing to look forward to.

If u need to talk I\u2019ll be here all day and night.",

        "body": "Young person, read carefully. \n\nI have several severe mental issues along with the really bad side of ADHD. I personally believe everyone hates me no matter how great the conversation plays out. I spend everyday trying to pull myself up. So I will tell you a story and I want you to digest this, internalize and rationalize your thoughts. Like I have to do every day, this is key. \n \nI have attempted suicide 2 times. All at my lowest point of my depression all stemming from my ADHD -the bad side of having it and growing up without actual care- I became addicted to pills and over dosed twice. I too thought I wasn\u2019t smart, that no body liked me as a person and especially getting the same flack at home from my parents that my RSD(rejection sensitivity disorder) would tell me. It\u2019s almost like a voice in my head  but it actually hurts. I was diagnosed late in life because of the US didn\u2019t take mental health seriously. So it went untreated leading to me believing I was the worst thing in existence. What we are doing here, what you are doing in this post is healthy, talking about it really helps and honesty is actually an incredible feeling. Like I said rationalize your thoughts, this is how I get through my RSD sending me spiraling. If I think someone hates me I tell them about RSD and most of the time people have never heard of it but always express some validation I needed to rationalize. By no means am I equating my disorder to what you\u2019re going through, I can only imagine because of where I was. \n\nI am now in my mid 30s and over the last year I have hit rock bottom again after being injured at work. I will have great difficulty walking for the rest of my life, my work abandoned me and so did workers comp. I will lose everything by the end of the month. I\u2019ve lost my insurance and my medications. Currently,  I am spiraling and like you I am terrified of getting older. Trying to talk you off a ledge has set me at ease. Genuinely, thank you for helping me off my ledge but right now you\u2019re important. \n\nTake a look around your immediate area. Is your area clean? What I\u2019m suggesting is make your space something you can have pride in for you. Create your safe space, fill it with love for you. Whatever it is that makes you feel good and can retreat to. Please also talk to yourself out loud, hear your own voice so you can actually hear what you\u2019re thinking of doing, talk to friends that support you and just tell them the truth. Then think about your path, you\u2019re scared of getting older. Like I was and still am, what\u2019s scaring you and how do you talk about it so you understand what you can do to steer away from the fears and look at it as something beautiful. If you\u2019re surrounded by toxicity, people who don\u2019t understand you or even if you haven\u2019t given them the respect to know what you\u2019re going through. Identifying the issues and creating the solutions, unfortunately fall on us. This can make you feel trapped, especially if you have no support or won\u2019t accept support. The world is yours, it\u2019s just run by unimportant people. \n\nI really hope you find something and continue to grow. \nWhen I took those pills and started drifting out, I could hear my parents fighting for me. They found me in my room on the floor leaving. It is my biggest regret having almost put them through that, not once but twice and on purpose. All because I couldn\u2019t speak, you have a voice and you are beautiful. Man or woman, the only ugly people are the ones that only take from others and deny people the decency to just live. Have integrity for yourself and find your way. Maybe you will stay up from spiraling and come across someone who has been where you are and you can try save them from that pit. \n\nI promise you, it\u2019s worth it to at least continue to try. I\u2019m saying this even though I am currently about to be homeless. Instead of trying to figure out what the hell I\u2019m going to do, I am trying to help you. So please, learn who you are, who you want to be. Not societies views of what you should be. Who YOU want to be and make it happen. If you say dead then I might as well relapse right now because you\u2019re far better off than I am. You have time to read EVERYTHING and practice things to make yourself the best you can. I\u2019ll tell you something my dad used to say to me that I thought was the stupidest shit growing up. I learned what that lesson meant by the time I was 30. I won\u2019t tell you, you need to think about it. \n\n\u201cI can show you the water, but I can\u2019t make you drink it.\u201d \n\nI mean that, your post walked me off my ledge. I want you to find out what the water means to you. Remember to have integrity, always show love no matter how hard it is and talk, out loud or to someone. If someone doesn\u2019t understand you, educate them on how you feel. No body is going to understand you if you don\u2019t let them in. Don\u2019t follow others. Trust yourself and you will be surrounded by what will make you happy, it always finds us. Learn who you are, not what you think you are.",

Just ignore everything and just focus on what you love and I promise you you will be happy then. Just talk to your family friends and do what you love do what makes you happy and you will be happier than ever before. This is the mentality I have been going on with the past 4 yrs and let me tell you it works \ud83d\ude09.",

If the friendship got together what will be in future positive or negative outcomes. What if the person broke up again. It becomes boring.

I could write multiple paragraphs on how messed up and complicated it is, but the most important bit is to remember depression isn't just \"having the big sad\". It's this lingering darkness in the back of your very soul. You can laugh one day, be a little down the next, happy again...and then one day you feel like every nerve in your body is being poisoned with guilt, rage, misery and so forth. It's not something you just \"get over\". Sometimes it has its roots, like childhood trauma, and other times people just grow hollow and it's tied to their very existence. Sadly it's different for everyone, so my description might only apply to a select few. Goodluck, brother.",
